As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.", "Epidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimating epidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubation period and the case fatality rate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) .

Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.", "We are interested in the critical tracing coverage, i.e. what proportion of non-household contacts needs to be found and isolated to control the outbreak, and in the epidemic growth rate (or epidemic doubling time) without and with contact tracing and isolation.

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18.

However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.", "is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417 doi: medRxiv preprint date of departure from Wuhan cuts the line segment in between.

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.", "To identify accurately a timeframe for evaluating early shifts in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China, we first estimated from case data the average incubation period of COVID-19 infection (i.e. the duration between time of infection and symptom onset (6, 7) ). Since infection events are typically not directly observed, we estimate incubation period from the span of exposure during which infection likely occurred. Using detailed information on 38 cases for whom both the dates of entry to and exit from Wuhan are known, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days (std. dev. = 3.0 days; Fig. S1 ), similar to previous estimates from other data (8, 9) . In subsequent analyses we add an upper estimate of one incubation period (mean + 1 standard deviation = 8 days) to the date of Wuhan shutdown, in order to delineate the date before which cases recorded in other provinces might represent infections acquired in Hubei (i.e. 1 st February 2020; Fig. 1a ). In order to understand whether the volume of travel within China can predict the epidemic outside of Wuhan, we analyzed real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc., together with epidemiological data from each province (Materials and Methods). Small local transmission clusters (in a family) of COVID-19 were first reported in Guangzhou, Guangdong province (14) . We investigated spatio-temporal disease spread to elucidate the relative contribution of Wuhan to transmission elsewhere and evaluate how the cordon sanitaire may have impacted it.", "Background Recent studies have focused initial clinical and Epidemiologic characteristics on the COVID-19, mainly revealing situation in Wuhan, Hubei. Aim To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China. Design Retrospective case series. Methods 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. Results Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia.

Amongst the cases in Mainland China, 2239 cases died, 11 cases of death was reported from out of Mainland China. 7 There were 41 initial cases of COVID-19 that were directly or indirectly linked to the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as reported by Huang and colleagues. 8 The clinical features include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, decreased leukocyte counts and computed tomography (CT) evidence of pneumonia. 8 Subsequently, Chen and colleagues reported 99 cases from a single centre of Wuhan, but the severe and non-severe cases were not compared. 9 And then Wang and colleagues published a study based on 138 hospitalized patients from Wuhan. 10 However, all these studies are based on cases identified in Wuhan. Recently, Guan and colleagues reported 1099 cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 552 hospitals across 31 provinces/provincial municipalities. 11 They reported that the median age was 47.0 years, 41.90% were females, 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted people from Wuhan, and the average incubation period was 3.0 days.

We estimated the incubation period from 38 travelling cases returning from Wuhan with known dates of symptom onset, entry and exit. The end of the exposure period was assumed to be the exit travel date except if symptom onset occurred prior to the exit date (in which case exposure was assumed to have occurred prior to symptom onset). The start of the exposure period corresponded to the entry date. We assumed that the incubation period could not exceed 30 days.", "Summary Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35\u201360). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0\u00b70009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5\u00b72%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

We analysed a subset of patients returning from Wuhan who had spent less than a week in Wuhan, to ensure a narrowly defined exposure window. The incubation period was estimated as the midpoint between the time spent in Wuhan and the date of symptom onset.", "Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis.

Or data may lack meaningful exposure history. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the incubation time will show some statistically significant with respect to Age and Gender. In this study, we aim to accurately estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of datasets with a well-documented history of exposure. Our results show the incubation mean and median of COVID-19 are 5.84 and 5.0 days respectively and there is a statistical significance with the role of gender. However, the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years show a statistically significant difference. Our machine learning analysis also shows that the two groups are linearly separable that demonstrate a clear boundary in knowledge discovery visualization.", "Our studies indicate that incubation periods of the age>=40 years and age<40 years groups not only statistically significant but also linearly separable in machine learning. It may suggest different treatments should be considered for the two different groups. It will be more interesting to estimate different incubation time for them separately. That the estimated 97.5 th percentile of COVID-19 incubation is 12.89 days (95% CI: (11.00, 16.13)) may suggest a long isolation or quarantine time (e.g. 17 days) can be better than the widely accepted 14 days. Furthermore, different quarantine time should be applied to the age>=40 years and age<40 years groups for their different incubation periods. Generally speaking, a longer quarantine time can be considered for the old patients (>=40 years) than young patients (<40 years old).

It indicates that the younger group tends to have a shorter incubation period. The variance of their incubation period also seems to be smaller. The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there's a statistically significant difference between the incubation of age<40 and age>=40 groups with the null hypothesis: the medians of incubation period between two groups are the same. The p-values for corresponding alternative hypotheses: the age<40 group has a smaller incubation median is 0.00474. It suggests that the age<40 group has a shorter incubation period than the age>=40 group. Similarly, the Siegal-Tukey test indicates the younger group's incubation variance is less than the older group's by p-value: 0.0083. It may suggest COVID-19 has a faster but relatively constant spread speed among people <40 years old than people >=40 years old. Figure 4 illustrates biplots of the dataset by removing two cases with missing items by using PCA (principal component analysis), sparse PCA (sparse principal component analysis, t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), and LLE (locally linear embedding) [16] [17] [18] [19] . Data is partitioned as the age>=40 and age<40 groups in visualization. t-SNE shows that only one case in the age>=40 group falls in the cluster of the age < 40 group. But PCA, sparse PCA and LLE all show that the incubation of two groups is linearly separable, which means there exists an obvious linear boundary to separate them, in the subspaces generated by PCA, SPCA, t-SNE, or LLE. Such machine learning results indicate that the two groups are actually independent clusters spatially. However, we also find that the incubation data will no longer demonstrate the linear separability property when we partition it as age>=50 and age<50 groups or age>=55 All rights reserved.

Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99).

Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. Those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of the COVID-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically. We need to support especially people who suspended working during the outbreak. Our results also highlight that people who are usually active, as indicated by more exercises, might be more suspectable to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown. Policymakers who are thinking of introducing measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and welling implications.", "We conducted a cross-sectional survey one month into the COVID-19 outbreak on February 20-21, 2020, about one month into the COVID-19 emergency in China. All the participants were adults not affected by the virus epidemiologically but they lived in locations that were affected by COVID-19 to varying degrees. To cover people in areas of varying severity of COVID-19, we surveyed adults from 64 prefectures across China. The 64 prefectures were chosen to cover a wide spectrum of regions based on the severity of COVID-19 and should not be taken as a representative national sample. All respondents agreed to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee at Tongji University. We reached 529 adults, and 369 of them answered the survey, with a response rate of 69\u00b78%.", "Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.", "Based on the COVID-19 daily updates from provincial and municipal health commissions in China, we notice that there is an abundance of cases who asymptomatically left Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, and developed symptoms outside Wuhan. Assuming that these cases were infected before their departure from Wuhan, the time differences between departure and symptoms onset is the censored observations of their incubation periods. Hence, we conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by assuming to catch those asymptomatic individuals at their departure time and followed them until their symptoms developed. Using the language of renewal processes, we can treat the development of the disease starting from infection by a pathogen as a stochastic process that could be observed from a specific time point in chronological order. In this study, the specific time point refers to the time of departure from Wuhan. For each prevalent case, the complete process from the infection to the onset of symptoms can be considered as a renewal process. As illustrated in Figure 1 , the backward recurrence time is hence defined as the time between infection and departure from Wuhan, and the forward recurrence time is the time between departure from Wuhan and symptom onset. Clearly, the forward time is observable and the corresponding observations are with good veracity, while the backward time is either unable to be observed or the corresponding observations are with large uncertainty due to recall bias. Note that for each infected individual, the backward time and forward time do not have to be same. However, when the renewal process reaches its equilibrium status, it becomes reversible, that is, the statistical properties of this process is the same as the one for time-reversed data in a same process. Hence, at equilibrium, the backward time can be treated as the forward time if time periods are reversed. 19 In order to model incubation using the renewal process properly, the following assumptions are established:", "Summary Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. Methods We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1\u00b75. For R0 values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

A draw from the negative binomial distribution with mean reproduction number (R 0 ) and distribution parameter determines how many people person A potentially infects. For each of those, a serial interval is drawn. Two of these exposures occur before the time person A is isolated. Each contact is traced with probability \u03c1, with probability 1-\u03c1 they are missed by contact tracing. Person B is successfully traced, which means that they will be isolated without delay when they develop symptoms. They could, however, still infect others before they are isolated. Person C is missed by contact tracing. This means that they are only detected if and when symptomatic, and are isolated after a delay from symptom onset. Because person C was not traced, they infected two more people (E and F), in addition to person D, than if they had been isolated at symptom onset. A version with subclinical transmission is given in the appendix (p 12). set to the incubation period for that case, an SD of 2, and a skew parameter chosen such that a set proportion of serial intervals were shorter than the incubation period (meaning that a set proportion of transmission happened before symptom onset; figure 2 ). This sampling approach ensured that the serial interval and incubation period for each case was correlated, and prevented biologically implausible scenarios where a case could develop symptoms soon after exposure, but not become infectious until very late after exposure and vice versa.", "Since the escalation of COVID-19 to a public health emergency in China on Jan 21, 2020, over a billion people across China have faced restrictions due to varying degrees of confinement such as .

Table 4 shows that the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and individual life satisfaction depends on individuals' existing health and exercise status. The severity of COVID-19 had a negative relationship with the life satisfaction only for people with chronic medical issues (\u03b2=-2\u00b711, p=0\u00b7036, 95% CI -4\u00b709 --0\u00b713) but not for people without chronic medical issues (\u03b2=-0\u00b701, p=0\u00b7510, 95% CI -0\u00b702 -0\u00b701). We plot the effect of the severity of COVID-19 on life satisfaction by whether the individuals had chronic medical issues in Figure 1 .", "Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00b1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.", "A respiratory disease spreading involves numerous factors. This simulation model uses only arbitrary data to make the calculation. And also, parameters are simplified to make the calculation faster, the results may be varying from real data. The model should be modified using actual data in order to get more accurate results.", "(A1). The renewal process has reached its equilibrium status;", "In this study, it is reasonable to assume (A1) is satisfied between January 19, 2020, and January 23, 2020, because there are over eleven million residents in the Wuhan metropolitan area and nearby neighborhoods and the daily travel volume in and out of Wuhan exceeded million before January 23, 2020. We justify the use of data between January 19 and January 23 below. With adequate long run, the renewal process would reach the equilibrium status. The assumptions (A2) to (A4) are standard. In fact, we may assume that the incubation period is a continuous variable with range is below. Therefore, the probability renewal process theory can be applied with confidence, and thus we can avoid the challenging mission of ascertaining the backward time.", "The adults also provided their socio-demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, education, and their location (prefecture). Using their locations, we searched for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in their prefectures on February 20 as well as the total population to calculate the number of confirmed cases per 10,000 people as an indicator of the severity of COVID-19 at their location. The number of cases per 10,000 people (i.e. infected rate) varied from 42\u00b745 (Wuhan) to 0\u00b701 on February 21. 16 Because COVID-19 is more dangerous for people with comorbidity, 17 it is likely that people who have ongoing medical issues would suffer more during the outbreak and therefore we asked whether the participants had any chronic disease. On the contrary, people who lead a healthy lifestyle and exercise often would be expected to fare better during the outbreak. Hence, we also asked the participants to indicate 'how many hours did you exercise per day during the past week'.", "Background: The city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.", "Regional variations in the association between outflowing traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence worth closer examination. Longer time lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence was observed in provinces closer to Wuhan or with more population influx from Wuhan, such as Henan, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Sichuan. Longer lagged effect does not mean these provinces were less responsive to imported cases. Rather, it means the overall changes in cumulative incidence in these provinces were not only driven by imported cases but also infected cases through local transmissions. For example, the lag was estimated to be 23 days for Henan province, which was severely affected by COVID-19. Although Henan province was among the earliest to implement traffic control, the COVID-19 incidences grew steadily after the traffic control. It is possible that the influx of Wuhan emigrants, mostly people who returned home from work/school, led to significant local transmissions in Henan, which outweighed the imported cases in driving the cumulative incidence to grow for a prolonged period. Given the median incubation period of 4-6 days for COVID-19 [11] , the overall COVID-19 incidence in provinces with lags of 2-3 weeks, or approximately 2-3 times the median incubation period, could be reflective of the second-or third-generation transmissions. Also, provinces with longer lag tend to have higher cumulative incidence, suggesting widespread local transmissions.", "The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.", "To identify accurately a timeframe for evaluating early shifts in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China, we first estimated from case data the average incubation period of COVID-19 infection (i.e. the duration between time of infection and symptom onset (6, 7) ). Since infection events are typically not directly observed, we estimate incubation period from the span of exposure during which infection likely occurred. Using detailed information on 38 cases for whom both the dates of entry to and exit from Wuhan are known, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days (std. dev. = 3.0 days; Fig. S1 ), similar to previous estimates from other data (8, 9) . In subsequent analyses we add an upper estimate of one incubation period (mean + 1 standard deviation = 8 days) to the date of Wuhan shutdown, in order to delineate the date before which cases recorded in other provinces might represent infections acquired in Hubei (i.e. 1 st February 2020; Fig. 1a ). In order to understand whether the volume of travel within China can predict the epidemic outside of Wuhan, we analyzed real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc., together with epidemiological data from each province (Materials and Methods). Small local transmission clusters (in a family) of COVID-19 were first reported in Guangzhou, Guangdong province (14) . We investigated spatio-temporal disease spread to elucidate the relative contribution of Wuhan to transmission elsewhere and evaluate how the cordon sanitaire may have impacted it.", "There are many estimates of the reproduction number for the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak The incubation distribution estimate fitted to data from the Wuhan outbreak by Backer and colleagues. 22 (C) An example of the method used to sample the serial interval for a case that has an incubation period of 5 days. Each case has an incubation period drawn from the distribution in (B), their serial interval is then drawn from a skewed normal distribution with the mean set to the incubation period of the case. In (C), the incubation period was 5 days. The skew parameter of the skewed normal distribution controls the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset; the three scenarios explored are less than 1%, 15%, and 30% of transmission before onset. in Wuhan, China, 15, 17, 18, 21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and therefore we used the values 1\u00b75, 2\u00b75, and 3\u00b75, which span most of the range of current estimates (table) . We used the secondary case distribution from the 2003 SARS outbreak, 19 and tested the effect of lower heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases 29 as a sensitivity analysis (appendix pp 2-5).

As the role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well constrained, it is important to obtain more-precise estimates through alternative sampling methods. We actively recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. Nasopharyngeal swabs, demographics, and survey information on symptoms, medical history, and recent travel were obtained from 2,685 adults over two seasonal arms. We used multiplex PCR to test swab specimens for a selection of common respiratory viruses. A total of 6.2% of samples (168 individuals) tested positive for at least one virus, with 5.6% testing positive in the summer arm and 7.0% testing positive in the winter arm. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 65 (38.7%) for coronavirus (CoV), and 18 (10.2%) for other viruses (including adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus). Depending on the definition of symptomatic infection, 65% to 97% of infections were classified as asymptomatic. The best-fit model for prediction of positivity across all viruses included a symptom severity score, Hispanic ethnicity data, and age category, though there were slight differences across the seasonal arms. Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are common in human populations, causing significant levels of morbidity. Understanding the distribution of these viruses is critical for designing control methods. However, most data available are from medical records and thus predominantly represent symptomatic infections. Estimates for asymptomatic prevalence are sparse and span a broad range. In this study, we aimed to measure more precisely the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in a general, ambulatory adult population. We recruited participants from a New York City tourist attraction and administered nasal swabs, testing them for adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. At recruitment, participants completed surveys on demographics and symptomology. Analysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus. While participants who tested positive were more likely to report symptoms than those who did not, over half of participants who tested positive were asymptomatic.", "These findings build on our previously reported summer arm study and provide an estimate of baseline prevalence of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory population across seasons. The results indicate that nearly 1 in 17 adults is shedding respiratory virus across seasons and that nearly 1 in 14 do so during the peak winter month. There is evidence of a difference in virus species prevalence among seasons, with HRV being the most prevalent virus species during the summer arm (more than half of all reported summer infections were HRV infections) and coronavirus being dominant during the winter arm (more than half of all winter infections reported were coronavirus infections). The impact of shedding prevalence on contagiousness or transmission is not yet well defined, however.", "The findings presented here indicate a significant level of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory adult population across seasons, as well as a substantial proportion of infections that are asymptomatic. These results could help improve estimates of virus incidence and inform disease transmission modeling and forecasting, which could then be used to support control efforts. Indeed, determination of respiratory virus prevalence in nonclinical settings can help with the design of control measures in the real-world settings where most transmission occurs. Future potential work in this area could include replicating this study in other highly frequented areas in the city (e.g., subway stations and parks) and enrolling children in order to obtain estimates across a broader age range.", "Background. The characteristics, determinants, and potential contribution to transmission of asymptomatic cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have not been well described. Methods. A cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) in coastal Kenya was recruited and followed for a 26-week period spanning a complete RSV season. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were requested weekly, during the first 4 weeks, and twice weekly thereafter from all household members, regardless of illness status. The samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Tests on 16 928 samples yielded 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals (37.1%) from 40 different households. Eighty-six episodes (42.0%) were asymptomatic. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes were higher age, shorter duration of infection, bigger household size, lower peak viral load, absence of concurrent RSV infections within the household, infection by RSV group B, and no prior human rhinovirus infections. The propensity of RSV spread in households was dependent on symptom status and amount (duration and load) of virus shed. Conclusions. While asymptomatic RSV was less likely to spread, the high frequency of symptomless RSV infection episodes highlights a potentially important role of asymptomatic infections in the community transmission of RSV.", "About one fourth (27%) of the asymptomatic index cases were linked with household spread, compared with 61% for the symptomatic index cases. We observed a strong positive correlation between the markers of RSV shedding (ie, duration and viral load) over the infection period ( Figure 4 ) and the probability of spread. Longer RSV infection episodes or those with a higher peak viral load were more likely to be symptomatic than their counterparts. The presence of symptoms and correlates of the amount of virus shedding (ie, duration and load) were independently associated with the risk of within-household spread among the index cases, after adjustment for age and household size. These findings taken together indicate that symptomatic individuals were more infectious and, thus, better transmitters than those without symptoms. The correlation of ARD and the amount of virus shedding suggests that vaccines that decrease viral shedding severity upon exposure to RSV, even if they do not reduce the risk of infection itself, could diminish virus transmission in the population. However, 34% of the symptomatic RSV episodes had the illness appear on average 4 days after first detection of the virus. If individuals change their behavior as a result of symptoms, such as by reducing their contacts, the period of shedding before symptoms appear or the prevalence of asymptomatic infections might have an accentuated role in transmission of RSV in the population. Furthermore, the high frequency of asymptomatic RSV cases observed in this study, coupled with the nonnegligible infectivity of the asymptomatic state, suggests that these individuals could play an important role in the transmission of RSV in a population.", "We report the prevalence of asymptomatic RSV infections from a study following 47 households with 493 individuals over the 26 weeks of an RSV epidemic. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected twice weekly regardless of symptoms and screened for a range of respiratory viruses, including RSV. Over 40% of the 205 RSV infection episodes were asymptomatic. The probability of symptomless RSV infection increased with age, peaking at about 40 years, and declined in older ages (Supplementary Figure 2 ). This accords with published observations that the risk of severe disease from RSV infection decreases with age [14] [15] [16] [17] and increases in elderly individuals [18] . Evidence from experimental challenge and epidemiological studies also support these observations and provide possible mechanisms [9, 16, 19, 20 ]. An experimental study using RSV A2 strain in young adult volunteers, together with infection being determined by virus isolation, reported a greater risk of infection in individuals administered a high RSV inoculum, compared with those administered a low dose (57% vs 36%), with asymptomatic infections occurring in 63% and 40% of the infections, respectively [19] ; individuals who were infected had statistically lower serum neutralizing antibody titers than uninfected individuals. In another experimental infection study involving 13 adult volunteers, with low neutralizing antibody titers, 12 had detectable viral shedding and respiratory illness when administered a high dose of RSV A2 inoculum [19] . Even though these experiments used a prototype virus, rather than the wild-type virus as in the current study, their findings suggest that acquired immunity against RSV and physiological development of the airways could play an important role in reducing the severity of RSV-associated respiratory disease. Serological studies show that antibody produced during RSV infection in young children and elderly individuals is ineffective and associated with an inappropriate cytokine response and excess inflammation of the airways [21] , partly explaining the increased disease severity in these age groups. RSV has been identified as an important pathogen in older ages [22] . In a US family study by Hall et al that used a similar intensive specimen collection regimen but detection by virus culture [2] , the prevalence of asymptomatic infection was low in families exposed to RSV, which could be due to exposure to large inoculum from close contacts within the household. Only 5% of infected individuals (2 of 39) had asymptomatic infection in the US study. In a study of infants admitted with RSV to intensive shedding in a household cohort study in Kenya, by clinical and household transmission status. Acute respiratory disease (ARD) presence is denoted by red, ARD absence is denoted by blue, and cases linked with virus spread are denoted by green. Data are mean values (95% confidence intervals). P values were calculated by 2-sided t tests comparing the mean values in index cases linked with spread, stratified by clinical status. Abbreviation: AU, arbitrary units. care units, Crowcroft et al reported a prevalence of asymptomatic infection, as determined by PCR of pernasal swabs, of 48% and 49% in the siblings and parents, respectively [23] . This suggests that the study by Hall et al [2] might have missed subclinical infections, particularly in older children and adults, owing to reduced sensitivity of the viral culture in asymptomatic cases. Alternatively, it is possible that in the present study, virus shed from asymptomatic cases was not viable, resulting in an overestimation of subclinical infections. We show that infection episodes with low peak viral load or absence of concurrent RSV infections in the household were associated with a reduced risk of ARD. In general, it appears that asymptomatic RSV infections are likely in individuals with previous exposure to RSV (and with concomitant high levels of neutralizing antibodies), such as older children and young adults [19] .", "While severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is increasing in prevalence throughout the world, there had not been a documented case of SARS in pregnancy until early 2003, when a pregnant woman infected with SARS sought care at this New Jersey Hospital in March 2003. As this patient was the only known pregnant SARS patient in the U.S., there was a critical need to balance patient privacy, confidentiality, general care needs and support with a worldwide need for knowledge about the outcomes from SARS infections. Here's how the hospital staff worked with all of the agencies to develop protocols and coordinate this mother's and infant's care.", "The guidelines for care were developed in consensus with all participants and were based on the evidence of prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV in the stool of convalescing patients. However, no evidence of transmission has been seen from asymptomatic patients convalescing or otherwise. There is no evidence to date for perinatal transmission, and it is unknown whether the shedding of SARS-CoV in human birth products occurs. What is known is that certain animal corona viruses are associated with fetal infection and demise. It's unknown whether birth products present an infection control risk in this circumstance.", "KEYWORDS asymptomatic infection, population health, respiratory viruses R espiratory virus infections are among the most common diseases in humans and cause significant morbidity and mortality across seasons and populations (1) . While respiratory virus infections can often be mild, these infections are typically undocumented, as individuals may not seek medical care because either the infection is asymptomatic or it elicits symptoms not severe enough to warrant seeking care. As a consequence, standard medical surveillance provides an incomplete picture of the epidemiology of respiratory infections. In this study, which was an extension of a previously published study focusing on infection in this population during only the summer months (2), we focused on ascertaining the rates of asymptomatic infection for the following suite of respiratory viruses: adenovirus, coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus (PIV). The population in this study was not only largely asymptomatic but also specifically ambulatory; we recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. We therefore might have missed sampling severely symptomatic patients who were not well enough to visit the attraction, but we nonetheless can estimate the levels of prevalence in a setting where transmission is likely.", "There are several limitations to this study. While the sampling scheme was designed to capture individuals from a population different from those represented in studies of persons seeking medical attention, it would not capture individuals who stay home with severe symptoms. However, given that the site used in the study is frequented by tourists, who usually only have a limited amount of time in New York City, we hypothesize that many people might still visit the site despite having symptoms that would otherwise keep them home. Consequently, our sample may be less skewed in symptom distribution than a random sample from the street. Conversely, among tourist attraction visitors, those with symptoms might have been more inclined to participate in this study. Symptoms were self-reported, which can introduce error, and were reported only for the previous 48 h. For some viruses, RNA can be detected for several weeks following infection, so some seemingly asymptomatic individuals who tested positive may have been previously infected and symptomatic. Further, shedding prior to symptom development also occurs (19) . These dynamics preclude calculation of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, but not estimation of asymptomatic prevalence in the ambulatory population, as the participants were asymptomatic at the time and were still shedding. Also, the study was run over two seasons, but there were no samples taken during the late summer or fall or early winter season, when prevalence levels may be different. For the diagnostic analysis, we performed a molecular test but did not try to isolate viruses or determine titers and therefore cannot confirm whether the virus collected in samples was viable. Lastly, this study excluded children, who have a high burden of respiratory virus infection.", "Asymptomatic infection rates may vary as a function of host age and virus. In one study, 52% of asymptomatic children recruited from an Alaskan community tested positive for shedding respiratory virus in a one-time sampling scheme, with the majority having HRV and adenovirus (7) . In another prospective surveillance investigation comparing positivity levels of symptomatic and asymptomatic infants in Perth, Australia, respiratory viruses were detected in 70% of samples from symptomatic infants and in 24.6% of samples from asymptomatic infants (8) . In general, among children, studies have found that 24.6% to 64% of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are asymptomatic (7) (8) (9) (10) . A number of studies have also documented the fraction of asymptomatic children who are shedding virus rather than the fraction of infected children who are asymptomatic. Calvo et al. documented an HRV shedding rate of 12.3% among healthy children (9) . Van Benten et al. found that 20% of asymptomatic infants \u05452 years old tested positive for HRV (11) . Similarly, Nokso-Koivisto et al. found that 20% of children without any past or recent respiratory infection symptoms tested positive for HRV or coronavirus (CoV) (12) . Other studies examining multiple respiratory agents documented respiratory virus infection in 40% and 42% of children without symptoms (13, 14) . The definition of symptomatic infection is not standardized, but most of these studies defined asymptomatic patients as those free from symptoms at the time of study participation or within a window around the time of enrollment. This wide variation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic presentations underscores the need for further studies to understand the distribution of symptoms across infec-tion statuses. Here, we document the shedding prevalence of a number of common respiratory viruses in an ambulatory adult population, as well as the distributions of symptomatology and symptom severity. Sampling was conducted in two seasonal arms: one carried out in the late spring/early summer (summer arm), which has been previously reported (2) , and one carried out in the late winter/early spring (winter arm). In the summer arm, we found that over 5% of individuals tested positive for respiratory virus, with the majority testing positive for HRV, but with over half also reporting being asymptomatic. We hypothesized that these numbers might vary by season, as many respiratory infections, as well as ambulatory population contact dynamics, display seasonal patterns. (Since we published our previous study, GenMark Diagnostics, the manufacturer of the respiratory viral panel [RVP] assay used to analyze these samples, determined that a higher cutoff value for positivity was warranted for some of the assayed viruses. This paper thus rereports the summer study with a cutoff value of 25 nA/mm 2 rather than 3 nA/mm 2 , so the numbers differ from those reported in Shaman et al. [2] .)", "Some previous studies have measured or inferred asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding prevalence levels; however, such estimates range widely across demographics, pathogens, and sampling approaches. A study carried out in Nashville, TN, and Salt Lake City, UT, recruited 238 completely asymptomatic adults (no symptoms within 14 days of recruitment), who were controls for patients with pneumonia, from among visitors to outpatient primary care clinics for routine health checks. Of these individuals, only 5 (2%) tested positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), coronavirus (CoV), or human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (3) . A different study, also based in Salt Lake City, UT, which prospectively recorded infection and symptoms over time within families recruited from the University of Utah campus community, found that 47% of respiratory infections among adults were asymptomatic. Influenza A virus, hMPV, CoV HKU1, and CoV OC43 were more frequently associated with symptoms (4). Among elderly adults enrolled in prospective surveillance in Rochester, NY, two studies have shown that very high proportions (80% to 90%) were symptomatic when infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and hMPV (5, 6) .", "The winter results presented in this paper largely confirm the findings reported in the previously published summer study, with some slight differences in seasonal prevalence and breakdown of infection composition. For the summer arm, the winter arm, and the entire study, respectively, 25.9%, 32.8%, and 29.6% of individuals testing positive reported no symptoms at all (symptom score of zero). These numbers indicate that though there may be a spectrum of symptom severity, a substantial number of infected individuals are completely asymptomatic. Regardless, the participants in this study, even if symptomatic by the definitions used (see Materials and Methods), felt well enough to visit a tourist attraction. There were few individuals who reported severe symptom scores or fever, indicating that those with severe symptomatology might have stayed home and thus were not captured in this study.", "The midpoint duration of shedding calculated in a previous publication [5] , which assumed that RSV shedding begins midway between the time of the preceding PCR-negative sample and first PCR-positive sample and ends midway between last positive and the next negative specimen of the episode, was used in this study. Episodes whose first sample was positive for both RSV group A and B counted as 1 infection episode and were assigned to either RSV group in the final analysis, depending on the RSV group with the higher peak viral load or longer virus shedding duration. An asymptomatic case was defined as the absence of any ARD symptoms in the course of the RSV infection episode. The timing of the start of symptoms was defined for every episode. The first person(s) in the household to acquire RSV infection, based on the date of sample collection, was referred to as the index case(s). A household RSV outbreak was identified when at least 1 other infection occurred during or within 14 days from the end of the infection episode of an index case in the same household. The outbreaks were confirmed to be of the same strain by comparing partial G gene sequences of the selected virus-positive specimens in the household [7] . The prevalence of asymptomatic RSV episodes was estimated and stratified by a number of characteristics, including age, infecting RSV group, sex, minimum Ct value during the episode, detection of other respiratory viruses before and during the episode, and presence of concurrent RSV infection in the same household. The minimum Ct value over the RSV episode was used as a proxy measure for the peak viral load, on the assumption that Ct values are inversely proportional to the quantity of specific viral nucleic acid in the sample [12] .", "For infectious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, some hosts may carry the pathogen and transmit it to others, yet display no symptoms themselves. These asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of disease but go largely undetected and can therefore undermine efforts to control transmission. Understanding the natural history of carriage and its relationship to disease is important for the design of effective interventions to control transmission. Mathematical models of infectious diseases are frequently used to inform decisions about control and should therefore accurately capture the role played by asymptomatic carriers. In practice, incorporating asymptomatic carriers into models is challenging due to the sparsity of direct evidence. This absence of data leads to uncertainty in estimates of model parameters and, more fundamentally, in the selection of an appropriate model structure. To assess the implications of this uncertainty, we systematically reviewed published models of carriage and propose a new model of disease transmission with asymptomatic carriage. Analysis of our model shows how different assumptions about the role of asymptomatic carriers can lead to different conclusions about the transmission and control of disease. Critically, selecting an inappropriate model structure, even when parameters are correctly estimated, may lead to over- or under-estimates of intervention effectiveness. Our results provide a more complete understanding of the role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission and highlight the importance of accurately incorporating carriers into models used to make decisions about disease control.", "The impact of control interventions on the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infection\u015d P I . Here we explore how interventions may change the endemic prevalence of symptomatic infectionsP I . Again, we only consider the case where R 0 > 1 so that the endemic equilibrium is stable and biologically meaningful. It is straightforward to show that", "One limitation of the study relates to the use of a Ct value of \u226435 to define virus-positive samples. The detection of RNA does not necessarily correlate with the presence of infectious virus. In the future, the Ct value associated with the potential to infect must be established, and assessment of the viability (infectiousness) of the viruses detected in asymptomatic infections is warranted. However, one fourth of the index cases linked with household spread were without symptoms in the current study. Despite the intensive sampling regimen, RSV infections with low viral load or short duration of shedding (<3 days), especially the asymptomatic cases, might have been missed. Our estimate of the prevalence of asymptomatic infections might be an underestimate, even though use of sensitive PCR screening methods might have diminished the detection bias.", "BACKGROUND: Common cold viruses create significant health and financial burdens, and understanding key loci of transmission would help focus control strategies. This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. METHODS: We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. RESULTS: Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children. Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home.", "HRV shedding largely coincides with symptoms and transmission [30] . Asymptomatic infections generally have lower viral loads [28] . Mean shedding of HRV 10-11 days with the duration of symptoms correlated with the duration of shedding, and never exceeding 28 days [31] . Reinfection also plays an important role in HRV. Volunteer studies have shown that shedding ceases within 11-21 days, implying that longer infections are likely due to reinfection [32, 33] . Longitudinal studies of infants and children with HRV show frequent serotype changes in infections with long durations [34, 35] .", "Abstract Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly infectious respiratory pathogen of domestic cats. The prevalence of FCV in the general cat population is high, particularly in multi-cat households, largely because many clinically recovered cats remain persistently infected carriers. In order to assess how FCV circulates in such groups and to assess the contribution that each individual animal makes to the epidemiology of the disease, we have carried out the first detailed analysis of long-term shedding patterns of FCV in individual cats within naturally infected colonies. The prevalence of FCV in each of the groups on individual sampling occasions ranged from 0% to 91%, with averages for the individual colonies ranging from 6% to 75%. Within each of the colonies, one to three distinct strains of FCV were identified. Individual cats showed a spectrum of FCV shedding patterns over the sampling period which broadly grouped into three categories: those that shed virus relatively consistently, those that shed virus intermittently, and those that appeared never to shed virus. This is the first report identifying non-shedder cats that appear resistant to FCV infection over long periods of time, despite being continually exposed to virus. Such resistance appeared to be age related, which may have been immune-mediated, although by analogy with other caliciviruses, factors such as host genetic resistance may play a role. Given that a proportion of the population appears to be resistant to infection, clearly the cohort of cats that consistently shed virus are likely to provide an important mechanism whereby infection can be maintained in small populations.", "In summary, this work describes the first detailed analysis of long-term shedding patterns of individual cats in naturally infected populations. The study shows that FCV can remain at a relatively high prevalence in colonies of cats over long periods of time, despite widespread use of vaccination. The observed high prevalence is maintained by large numbers of generally asymptomatically infected cats in colonies where a small number of distinct FCV strains are circulating. A spectrum of FCV shedding patterns were identified with cats broadly grouping into three categories; consistent shedders, intermittent shedders and non-shedders. The basis of the apparent resistance of the non-shedders remains to be determined, but may either be immune-mediated, or possibly host receptor driven."], "title": [], "doi": []}, "How is prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission for children?": {"answer": ["Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City.

As the role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well constrained, it is important to obtain more-precise estimates through alternative sampling methods. We actively recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. Nasopharyngeal swabs, demographics, and survey information on symptoms, medical history, and recent travel were obtained from 2,685 adults over two seasonal arms. We used multiplex PCR to test swab specimens for a selection of common respiratory viruses. A total of 6.2% of samples (168 individuals) tested positive for at least one virus, with 5.6% testing positive in the summer arm and 7.0% testing positive in the winter arm. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 65 (38.7%) for coronavirus (CoV), and 18 (10.2%) for other viruses (including adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus). Depending on the definition of symptomatic infection, 65% to 97% of infections were classified as asymptomatic. The best-fit model for prediction of positivity across all viruses included a symptom severity score, Hispanic ethnicity data, and age category, though there were slight differences across the seasonal arms. Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are common in human populations, causing significant levels of morbidity. Understanding the distribution of these viruses is critical for designing control methods. However, most data available are from medical records and thus predominantly represent symptomatic infections. Estimates for asymptomatic prevalence are sparse and span a broad range. In this study, we aimed to measure more precisely the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in a general, ambulatory adult population. We recruited participants from a New York City tourist attraction and administered nasal swabs, testing them for adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. At recruitment, participants completed surveys on demographics and symptomology. Analysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus. While participants who tested positive were more likely to report symptoms than those who did not, over half of participants who tested positive were asymptomatic.", "Asymptomatic infection rates may vary as a function of host age and virus.

The characteristics, determinants, and potential contribution to transmission of asymptomatic cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have not been well described. Methods. A cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) in coastal Kenya was recruited and followed for a 26-week period spanning a complete RSV season. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were requested weekly, during the first 4 weeks, and twice weekly thereafter from all household members, regardless of illness status. The samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Tests on 16 928 samples yielded 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals (37.1%) from 40 different households. Eighty-six episodes (42.0%) were asymptomatic. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes were higher age, shorter duration of infection, bigger household size, lower peak viral load, absence of concurrent RSV infections within the household, infection by RSV group B, and no prior human rhinovirus infections. The propensity of RSV spread in households was dependent on symptom status and amount (duration and load) of virus shed. Conclusions. While asymptomatic RSV was less likely to spread, the high frequency of symptomless RSV infection episodes highlights a potentially important role of asymptomatic infections in the community transmission of RSV.", "We report the prevalence of asymptomatic RSV infections from a study following 47 households with 493 individuals over the 26 weeks of an RSV epidemic. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected twice weekly regardless of symptoms and screened for a range of respiratory viruses, including RSV. Over 40% of the 205 RSV infection episodes were asymptomatic. The probability of symptomless RSV infection increased with age, peaking at about 40 years, and declined in older ages (Supplementary Figure 2 ). This accords with published observations that the risk of severe disease from RSV infection decreases with age [14] [15] [16] [17] and increases in elderly individuals [18] . Evidence from experimental challenge and epidemiological studies also support these observations and provide possible mechanisms [9, 16, 19, 20 ]. An experimental study using RSV A2 strain in young adult volunteers, together with infection being determined by virus isolation, reported a greater risk of infection in individuals administered a high RSV inoculum, compared with those administered a low dose (57% vs 36%), with asymptomatic infections occurring in 63% and 40% of the infections, respectively [19] ; individuals who were infected had statistically lower serum neutralizing antibody titers than uninfected individuals. In another experimental infection study involving 13 adult volunteers, with low neutralizing antibody titers, 12 had detectable viral shedding and respiratory illness when administered a high dose of RSV A2 inoculum [19] . Even though these experiments used a prototype virus, rather than the wild-type virus as in the current study, their findings suggest that acquired immunity against RSV and physiological development of the airways could play an important role in reducing the severity of RSV-associated respiratory disease. Serological studies show that antibody produced during RSV infection in young children and elderly individuals is ineffective and associated with an inappropriate cytokine response and excess inflammation of the airways [21] , partly explaining the increased disease severity in these age groups. RSV has been identified as an important pathogen in older ages [22] . In a US family study by Hall et al that used a similar intensive specimen collection regimen but detection by virus culture [2] , the prevalence of asymptomatic infection was low in families exposed to RSV, which could be due to exposure to large inoculum from close contacts within the household. Only 5% of infected individuals (2 of 39) had asymptomatic infection in the US study. In a study of infants admitted with RSV to intensive shedding in a household cohort study in Kenya, by clinical and household transmission status. Acute respiratory disease (ARD) presence is denoted by red, ARD absence is denoted by blue, and cases linked with virus spread are denoted by green. Data are mean values (95% confidence intervals).

Abbreviation: AU, arbitrary units. care units, Crowcroft et al reported a prevalence of asymptomatic infection, as determined by PCR of pernasal swabs, of 48% and 49% in the siblings and parents, respectively [23] . This suggests that the study by Hall et al [2] might have missed subclinical infections, particularly in older children and adults, owing to reduced sensitivity of the viral culture in asymptomatic cases. Alternatively, it is possible that in the present study, virus shed from asymptomatic cases was not viable, resulting in an overestimation of subclinical infections. We show that infection episodes with low peak viral load or absence of concurrent RSV infections in the household were associated with a reduced risk of ARD. In general, it appears that asymptomatic RSV infections are likely in individuals with previous exposure to RSV (and with concomitant high levels of neutralizing antibodies), such as older children and young adults [19] .", "BACKGROUND: Common cold viruses create significant health and financial burdens, and understanding key loci of transmission would help focus control strategies.

Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home.", "HRV shedding largely coincides with symptoms and transmission [30] . Asymptomatic infections generally have lower viral loads [28] . Mean shedding of HRV 10-11 days with the duration of symptoms correlated with the duration of shedding, and never exceeding 28 days [31] . Reinfection also plays an important role in HRV. Volunteer studies have shown that shedding ceases within 11-21 days, implying that longer infections are likely due to reinfection [32, 33] . Longitudinal studies of infants and children with HRV show frequent serotype changes in infections with long durations [34, 35] .", "A 15-month prospective longitudinal study of diarrhea and rotavirus (RV) infection was conducted concurrently in infants and toddlers in day care centers (DCCs) and in a large pediatric clinic in Houston. The mean number of children in the DCCs was 223; the diarrhea rate during the first 12 months was 2.62 episodes per child-year. Rotavirus accounted for approximately 10% of the total episodes of diarrhea in the pediatric clinic and DCC populations, but 50% during the winter months. The occurrence of RV in the DCCs paralleled that seen in the pediatric clinic. The annual rate of RV infection in DCCs was 0.55 episodes per child-year, with diarrhea occurring in only 40% of the episodes (0.22 episodes per child-year). There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community. The age distributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infections in DCC study children were not significantly different. In symptomatic RV-infected children in DCCs, 42% had RV identified in stool specimens within 2 days before diarrhea occurred. Thirty-eight DCC children had more than one episode of RV infection, but only five had two symptomatic RV infections. Diarrhea caused by RV is common in children in DCCs, often occurs in outbreaks due to the same strain, and parallels disease in the community; asymptomatic RV infection is also common in children in DCCs.", "Asymptomatic infection accounted for 60% of all identified RV-positive episodes in our DCC study children. This finding is consistent with earlier prevalence studies in Houston DCCs, in which 12% of children 0 to 24 months old were found to be asymptomatically shedding RV in their stools? ~ High rates of asymptomatic RV infection have also been reported among young children in Paris, Western Australia, and Costa Rica. [23] [24] [25] The overall observed rate of RV infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) was 0.55 per child-year, consistent with serosurveys in which virtually all children are found to be RV seropositive by the end of the second year of life. 26 Almost half of children with RV diarrhea tested within 2 days before illness were already shedding the virus. 15 This presymptomatic excretion of RV may be analogous to that of commonly encountered viral agents of upper respiratory tract infections. 27 Presymptomatic RV shedding and the high rate of asymptomatic RV infections are important potential factors in introduction and transmission of RV in DCCs and in the community at large.", "The findings presented here indicate a significant level of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory adult population across seasons, as well as a substantial proportion of infections that are asymptomatic. These results could help improve estimates of virus incidence and inform disease transmission modeling and forecasting, which could then be used to support control efforts. Indeed, determination of respiratory virus prevalence in nonclinical settings can help with the design of control measures in the real-world settings where most transmission occurs. Future potential work in this area could include replicating this study in other highly frequented areas in the city (e.g., subway stations and parks) and enrolling children in order to obtain estimates across a broader age range.", "In multivariate analysis of viral positivity, we found an expected association between having worse symptoms and testing positive for respiratory virus. We also found some evidence of an association of Hispanic ethnicity with being positive, in particular, for HRV. This association has been found previously in other studies of respiratory virus (17, 18) , especially in children. Some of the best-fit models also included the age category, although the only statistically significant result was that individuals aged 30 to 39 years were more likely to be positive than individuals aged 18 to 29 years. This association might be due to the fact that 30-to-39-year-old adults may be more likely to have or to be in contact with young children, who classically have a high prevalence of respiratory Manufacturer specifications, as well as data from previous studies, indicate that there is no association between eSensor signal intensity and the amount of virus present in a sample. However, in this study, we found evidence of an association between signal intensity and having allergies among all positives combined from both study arms and also among those in the winter arm alone (although not among those in the summer arm alone). There was, however, some association between signal intensity and age in the summer arm.", "There are several limitations to this study. While the sampling scheme was designed to capture individuals from a population different from those represented in studies of persons seeking medical attention, it would not capture individuals who stay home with severe symptoms. However, given that the site used in the study is frequented by tourists, who usually only have a limited amount of time in New York City, we hypothesize that many people might still visit the site despite having symptoms that would otherwise keep them home. Consequently, our sample may be less skewed in symptom distribution than a random sample from the street. Conversely, among tourist attraction visitors, those with symptoms might have been more inclined to participate in this study. Symptoms were self-reported, which can introduce error, and were reported only for the previous 48 h. For some viruses, RNA can be detected for several weeks following infection, so some seemingly asymptomatic individuals who tested positive may have been previously infected and symptomatic. Further, shedding prior to symptom development also occurs (19) . These dynamics preclude calculation of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, but not estimation of asymptomatic prevalence in the ambulatory population, as the participants were asymptomatic at the time and were still shedding. Also, the study was run over two seasons, but there were no samples taken during the late summer or fall or early winter season, when prevalence levels may be different. For the diagnostic analysis, we performed a molecular test but did not try to isolate viruses or determine titers and therefore cannot confirm whether the virus collected in samples was viable. Lastly, this study excluded children, who have a high burden of respiratory virus infection.", "BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. METHODS: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. RESULTS: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.", "To explore a potential association between severity of illness and the virus load, as reflected by the Ct values, Ct values were compared among asymptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms for the viruses detected in PSPs with a prevalence of > 5%. PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. In the case of CoV (HKU1, OC43)-positive PSPs, the Ct values were significantly lower than for RSV and IV in patients with severe clinical symptoms supported by radiographic evidence (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05, Fig. 4 ). CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were also observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. [15, 16] . These reported studies were limited to RSV, HRV/EV, and IV, possibly missing the other majority of respiratory viruses. In addition, these studies lacked quantitative analysis of viral pathogens in the PSPs. Though the frequency of symptomatic VRI was low, presence of VRI significantly prolonged postoperative recovery in children following surgery, as evidenced by longer LOS periods in hospitalization. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the infection rates and outcomes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic PSPs leading to VRI after surgery using qRT-PCR. As samples were taken not only from patients with symptoms of infection, but also from asymptomatic patients in this study, we were therefore able to explore the impact of viral testing in asymptomatic patients, which could help improve estimates of VRI in PSPs and further study of disease transmission modeling and forecasting. A total of 171 out of 1629 children (10.50%) were confirmed to have VRI with laboratory results, which is a considerably higher proportion than previous studies have identified. HRV/EV was the most common pathogen detected in 42.19% of PSPs, who had either mild symptoms or were asymptomatic, compared to previously reported 17% of asymptomatic controls and 22% of children with pneumonia enrolled at the same study sites during the same time period [19] . This might be owing to the high sensitivity of the proposed qRT-PCR assays identifying more viral pathogens. In this study, we also observed that HRV/EV were associated with prolonged shedding and the most commonly found coinfections were PIV3 and HRV/EV. These results are consistent with previous findings that HRV/EV co-infection or different HRV species co-infection were associated with acute respiratory illness hospitalization and that prolonged viral shedding over the course of 30 days was more commonly associated with respiratory viruses [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Because shedding of HRV can occur more than two weeks after infection [19] , it could be interpreted that HRV was the most commonly found co-infection pathogen in this study.", "These findings build on our previously reported summer arm study and provide an estimate of baseline prevalence of respiratory virus shedding in an ambulatory population across seasons. The results indicate that nearly 1 in 17 adults is shedding respiratory virus across seasons and that nearly 1 in 14 do so during the peak winter month. There is evidence of a difference in virus species prevalence among seasons, with HRV being the most prevalent virus species during the summer arm (more than half of all reported summer infections were HRV infections) and coronavirus being dominant during the winter arm (more than half of all winter infections reported were coronavirus infections). The impact of shedding prevalence on contagiousness or transmission is not yet well defined, however.", "Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.", "Unexpectedly, with the available data we were unable to conclusively identify patient sources of infection for any of the potential HAI instances identified (1.1 a; b; 2.1 b; 2.2; 3.3; 3.4 and 4.1 a). Furthermore, temporally-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggested that most instances of potential HAI in RXH-including instances where virus HA sequences were identical between different cases-likely resulted from independent introductions of Influenza A viruses into the hospital. Our inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of cases/viral isolates could be attributed to limited sampling in RXH during the study period which could imply that the viruses we detected originated in either asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors, or hospital staff. Transmission from asymptomatic patients is serious in the context of South Africa's high HIV prevalence. While studies have demonstrated that HIV-infection status alone in adults does not increase risk of Influenza infection, evidence suggests that prolonged Influenza shedding periods (> 1 week) can be observed in patients exhibiting non-HIV related immunosuppression [62, 63] . Such prolonged influenza positivity was exhibited in patient 1.1 Phylogeny as a Utility to Observe Influenza Nosocomial Transmission a, who remained influenza PCR positive for 15 days. In-spite of this, none of the RXH patients were HIV positive during the course of this study and thus could not account for prolonged ILI and possible influenza shedding in patient 1.1 a.", "Viral pneumonia is an important cause of death and morbidity among infants worldwide. Transmission of non-influenza respiratory viruses in households can inform preventative interventions and has not been well-characterised in South Asia. From April 2011 to April 2012, household members of pregnant women enrolled in a randomised trial of influenza vaccine in rural Nepal were surveyed weekly for respiratory illness until 180 days after birth. Nasal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses in symptomatic individuals. A transmission event was defined as a secondary case of the same virus within 14 days of initial infection within a household. From 555 households, 825 initial viral illness episodes occurred, resulting in 79 transmission events. The overall incidence of transmission was 1.14 events per 100 person-weeks. Risk of transmission incidence was associated with an index case age 1\u20134 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40\u20133.96), coinfection as initial infection (IRR 1.94; 95% CI 1.05\u20133.61) and no electricity in household (IRR 2.70; 95% CI 1.41\u20135.00). Preventive interventions targeting preschool-age children in households in resource-limited settings may decrease the risk of transmission to vulnerable household members, such as young infants.", "contribution of older children to transmission compared to the Kenyan cohort. Over half of RSV infections in children 5-15 years in that study were asymptomatic, with a smaller proportion of asymptomatic infections in infants under 1 year and children 1-4 years at 9% and 17%, respectively [28] . However, they also reported viral shedding in symptomatic RSV infections was 14 log 10 RNA copies greater than in asymptomatic RSV cases suggesting that symptomatic episodes are more likely to transmit virus [29] . Last, we collected weekly specimens and our findings may be biased if non-infant younger children had longer shedding duration compared to older children. However, this has not been demonstrated in studies of RSV and HRV shedding duration [28, 30] . Our large cohort allowed us to use a multivariable analysis to identify the risk factors and protective characteristics associated with the incidence of transmission. While both infants and preschool children were frequently identified as the index case in a transmission event and can shed virus for prolonged periods, a preschool child index case was associated with a twofold increased risk of transmission and an infant index case was associated with a decreased risk of transmission [11, 31, 32] . Whereas infants are more likely to transmit RSV via direct contact as compared with fomites, young children may transmit infection efficiently through both methods due to differences in mobility and behaviour [33] . Coinfection as the initial infection was associated with an increased risk of transmission, including in our multivariable model. Coinfections most commonly involved HRV and a greater proportion of coinfections resulted in a secondary case compared to monoinfection of most viruses. Viral coinfection with RSV infection has been demonstrated to increase RSV viral load and shedding duration. However, this has not been consistently seen, including a study analysing seven respiratory viruses [29 31, 34] . Finally, electricity in the household, a proxy for socio-economic status and housing conditions, was negatively associated with transmission. Although an association between indoor air pollution and RSV infection has been reported in resource-limited regions, smoking and biofuel cookstove use were not associated with the risk for transmission in our model [4] . However, we had limited power to detect this association due to the use of indoor biofuel cookstoves in over 90% of households in our model and exposures were self-reported without actual measures of indoor air pollution.", "Please cite this paper as: Arnott et al. (2013) Human bocavirus amongst an all\u2010ages population hospitalised with acute lower respiratory infections in Cambodia. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(2) 201\u2013210. Background Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus that is associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal tract disease. Objectives To investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBoV amongst hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in Cambodia. Study Design Samples were collected from 2773 patients of all ages hospitalised with symptoms of ALRI between 2007 and 2009. All samples were screened by multiplex RT\u2010PCR/PCR for 18 respiratory viruses. All samples positive for HBoV were sequenced and included in this study. Results Of the samples tested, 43 (1\u00b75%) were positive for HBoV. The incidence of HBoV did not vary between the consecutive seasons investigated, and HBoV infections were detected year\u2010round. The incidence of HBoV infection was highest in patients aged <2 years, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most common clinical diagnosis, regardless of age. A total of 19 patients (44%) were co\u2010infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory pathogen. All isolates were classified as HBoV type 1 (HBoV\u20101). High conservation between Cambodian NP1 and V1V2 gene sequences was observed. Conclusions Human bocavirus infection can result in serious illness, however is frequently detected in the context of viral co\u2010infection. Specific studies are required to further understand the true pathogenesis of HBoV in the context of severe respiratory illness.", "The proportion of HBoV infections detected amongst hospitalised Cambodian ALRI patients was significantly higher compared to that of Cambodian outpatients with ILI (1AE5% versus 0AE4%, P = 0AE02). 22 The higher incidence of HBoV infection amongst ALRI patients was not thought to be a result of a high carriage rate within the population. In parallel, the incidence of HBoV infection amongst Cambodian ILI outpatients and asymptomatic controls was investigated previously, with only one asymptomatic individual testing positive for HBoV DNA. 22 However, persistent and prolonged shedding is a characteristic of parvoviruses, and it is thought that low-level asymptomatic shedding can persist following HBoV infection. 20, 36, 37 Two independent stud-ies reported the HBoV carriage rate to be 43% amongst asymptomatic children, 38 and that the incidence of HBoV amongst asymptomatic children was higher than amongst symptomatic children. 39 However, these two studies were conducted amongst children aged <2 years. Hence, the high carriage rate may have been biased towards the very young age of the sample population with HBoV incidence highest amongst children aged <2 years. 1, 9, 40 Amongst a population of slightly older children, up to 5 years of age, Brieu et al. 36 reported that HBoV DNA was not detected following testing of asymptomatic children. In the absence of an established continuous culture system, it is currently unclear to what extent shedding occurs following HBoV infection, whether shedding and carriage rates amongst children and adults are equivalent, and whether shedding is innocuous or infectious. However, the higher incidence of HBoV infection amongst hospitalised Cambodian ALRI patients observed in this study relative to outpatients with ILI suggests that HBoV infection can result in severe illness."], "title": [], "doi": []}, "How Seasonality affects COVID-19 transmission?": {"answer": ["Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity.", "Introduction attempt to stop its spread.

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic.

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.", "We investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potential decreased transmission during the summer months.

However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1\u20131/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2\u00b75 in the early stages of the epidemic,2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.", "See Online for appendices 2, 3 R 0 of 2\u00b75 or higher, reductions in transmission by social distancing would have to be large; and much of the changes in transmission of pandemic influenza in the summer of 2009 within Europe were thought to be due to school closures, but children are not thought to be driving transmission of COVID-19. Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID-19 transmission.", "The fourth uncertainty is the duration of the infectious period for COVID-19. The infectious period is typically short for influenza A, but it seems long for COVID-19 on the basis of the few available clinical virological studies, perhaps lasting for 10 days or more after the incubation period. 8 The reports of a few super-spreading events are a routine feature of all infectious diseases and should not be overinterpreted. 10 What do these comparisons with influenza A and SARS imply for the COVID-19 epidemic and its control? First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID-19 had a doubling time in China of about 4-5 days in the early phases. 3 Second, the COVID-19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID-19 is unknown; 11 however, with an R 0 of 2-3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R 0 of around 1\u00b71-1\u00b75. 12 Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID-19 epidemic.", "There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.", "In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts. The intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes established and, to a lesser degree, upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of crossimmunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence.", "The speed of the initial spread of the epidemic, its doubling time, or the related serial interval (the mean time it takes for an infected person to pass on the infection to others), and the likely duration of the epidemic are determined by factors such as the length of time from infection to when a person is infectious to others and the mean duration of infectiousness. For the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, in most infected people these epidemiological quantities were short with a day or so to infectiousness and a few days of peak infectiousness to others. 3 By contrast, for COVID-19, the serial interval is estimated at 4\u00b74-7\u00b75 days, which is more similar to SARS. 4 First among the important unknowns about COVID-19 is the case fatality rate (CFR), which requires information on the denominator that defines the number infected. We are unaware of any completed large-scale serology surveys to detect specific antibodies to COVID-19. Best estimates suggest a CFR for COVID-19 of about 0\u00b73-1%, 4 which is higher than the order of 0\u00b71% CFR for a moderate influenza A season. 5 The second unknown is the whether infectiousness starts before onset of symptoms. The incubation period for COVID-19 is about 5-6 days. 4, 6 Combining this time with a similar length serial interval suggests there might be considerable presymptomatic infectiousness (appendix 1). For reference, influenza A has a presymptomatic infectiousness of about 1-2 days, whereas SARS had little or no presymptomatic infectiousness. 7 There have been few clinical studies to measure COVID-19 viraemia and how it changes over time in individuals. In one study of 17 patients with COVID-19, peak viraemia seems to be at the end of the incubation period, 8 pointing to the possibility that viraemia might be high enough to trigger transmission for 1-2 days before onset of symptoms. If these patterns are verified by more extensive clinical virological studies, COVID-19 would be expected to be more like influenza A than SARS. For SARS, peak infectiousness took place many days after first symptoms, hence the success of quarantine of patients with SARS soon after symptoms started 7 and the lack of success for this measure for influenza A and possibly for COVID-19.", "The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.", "Containment of respiratory infections is particularly difficult if they are characterized by relatively mild symptoms or transmission before the onset of disease (25) . Intensive control measures, including travel restrictions, have been implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19 in China. Here, we showed that this combination of interventions was successful in mitigating the spread and reduce local transmission of COVID-19 in China although it is not possible to definitively determine the individual impact of each intervention. More analyses will be required to determine how to optimally balance the expected positive effects on health with the negative impact on individual liberties, the economy, and society at large.", "The 2019-Novel-Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 115 countries and out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases. Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-10 reported cases show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-03-12; daily updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South Korea's rate of 0.76% (10% lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in china and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all non-essential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea and reducing working hours in Iran.", "Human coronaviruses (HCoV) which causes gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, were first introduced by the discovery of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, from the nasal cavities of human patients with the common cold, in 1960s (Myint, 1994 1 4 ). The name refers to the morphology of the virus, when viewed under 2D transmission electron microscopy (large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface) and stems from the Latin word \"corona\", meaning \"crown\" (Goldsmith et al., 2004 5 ) . Concerning the risk factor, HCoVs vary significantly; from the relatively harmless ones (i.e., common cold) to the most lethal ones (MERS-CoV, with more than 30% mortality rate in the infected) (Fehr & Perlman, 2015 6 ). CoVs spread during cold seasons and cause colds with major symptoms, i.e., fever, sore throat, and less commonly pneumonia and bronchitis for the more aggressive strains. To date, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs capable of preventing or treating HCoV infections (Fehr & To date, several outbreaks of coronavirus-related diseases have been reported. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-or SARS was the first coronavirus-related outbreak, starting in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, and spread to a total of 29 territories, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, within 9 months. It infected a total of 8,098 people and killed 774 worldwide (Smith, 2006 9 ). The second coronavirus-related outbreak happened in the Middle East in April 2012, officially named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS. This virus was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia, and later, MERS affected several other countries, including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirate, Jordan, Qatar, and Oman. Overall resulting with infections in 24 countries, with over 1,000 cases and over 400 deaths (Organization 10 ). The outbreak of MERS happened again in South Korea, supposedly from a traveler from Middle East. It happened during May and July 2015, and infected a total of 186 individuals, with a death toll of 36 (Organization, 2015 11 ). After 3 years in August 2018, the next MERS outbreak happened in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, and resulted in almost 147 infected people and the death of 47. The MERS outbreak had been reported in Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, and South Korea. In Dec 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, and on Dec 31, it was attributed to a new strain of HCoV, first named as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO), and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Almost 2 weeks later, on Jan. 11, 2020, Chinese state media reported the first fatality from the new discovered virus, that led to infection of dozens more. As of Jan 20, multiple countries reported their first cases, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand. The first confirmed case in the United States came the very next day in Washington State. Continuing its spread, Coronavirus presence was confirmed throughout the month of February in the Philippines (Feb 2), France (Feb 14), Iran (Feb 21), and as reports started in Italy on Feb 23; many more Europeans countries followed suit, reporting their first confirmed cases. As of this writing, the coronavirus has affected 115 countries, out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases, around 4,000 people have lost their lives. With China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea experiencing the worst cases of outbreaks and showing no sign of alleviation, the 2019-2020 outbreak of COVID-19 is now officially recognized as a pandemic by WHO. An outbreak or epidemic often refers to a sudden increase in the occurrence of an infectious disease, in a particular time and place. Pandemics are near-global epidemic outbreaks, where multiple countries across the world are involved (Green et al., 2002 12 ). The mentioned rapid trend of spread prompts a lot of concerns and questions such as; \"How fast is the virus spreading?\", \"which policies or efforts could control the disease better?\", and \"what is the main difference of COVID-19 outbreak with pervious epidemics?\" Fortunately, the daily case detection changes are available and can be tracked almost in real time on the website provided by authors (http://iuwa.ir/corona/). The aim of this study is to provide the transmission trend from China to other countries and to report the daily confirmed cases, case fatalities and surveillance in every countries from the first day of outbreak until March 4th. Also, to evaluate the effect of each government policies in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.", "Using a transmission model we evaluate the impact of self-imposed measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and 93 social distancing) due to awareness about COVID-19 and of a short-term government-imposed social distancing 94 intervention on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses since 95 the first case.

Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.", "Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.", "As of March 13th, the number of cases that tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy amounted to 17,660, the number of deaths to 1,266 and the number of recovered to 1,439.

However, there are still some shortcomings and challenges that must be overcome which will be looked upon in this chapter.", "(a) Particle size: Particle size holds important information of studying the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles, their biodistribution, and their retention the tissues. Smaller the size of nanoparticle, larger the surface area it possesses. The small size of nanomaterials facilitates its easier cell penetration (cell wall and cell membrane), thereby promoting cellular dysfunctioning. Cellular uptake of nanomaterials is inversely related to their particle size. Many advanced techniques are available, which helps in determining the size of the nanomaterials that are listed here: Photon-correlation spectroscopy (PCS) or dynamic light scattering (DLS): It qualifies to be the most admired and speedy technique that determines the nano-and submicron ranges of Brownian nanoparticles in a colloidal suspension. The mode of determination of particle size involves Doppler shift due to Brownian motion of nanoparticles against monochromatic light beam (LASER). The interaction of light beam with particle results into shift in the wavelength of incoming light which is used to correlate the size and motion of the particle in the colloidal suspension (DeAssis et al., 2008) . Scanning electron microscopy: It is the most customary method to ascertain shape, size, and surface morphology of the nanoparticles. They help in directly visualizing the morphology of nanomaterials; however, their information about size distribution and average population tends to be of limited benefit. The technique is costly and timeconsuming and requires complementary information for the data accuracy (Molpeceres et al., 2000) (Fig. 19 .1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): It provides image, diffraction patterns, and spectroscopic data of the material. High-resolution TEM imaging can be coalesced to nanodiffraction, atomic resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (AREES), and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (X-ray EDS) techniques to investigate their properties in advancement. They have much more advancement when studying biological sample as compared to thick-stained section studies. Atomic force microscopy: The technique is also known as scanning force microscopy (SFM). A probe tip of atomic scale is used to physically scan samples at submicron level. The method holds an advantage above every morphological study process. The study of biological samples in AFM requires no specific treatment and therefore easily provides details for biological and delicate polymeric samples. It provides the most accurate data for size, size distribution, and morphology and hence is most suitable method for studying the interaction of nanomaterials with biological samples (Polakovic et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2013) . Other techniques include differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which are new methodologies based on high resolution and are quite useful for biological systems such as proteins, DNA, and RNA (Sikora et al., 2016) . (b) Morphology and surface area: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive technique for analyzing exact elemental ratio, composition, and bonding nature of elements in the nanomaterials. Their vibrational characteristics can be studied by FTIR and Raman spectral analysis. The fingerprint region of these spectral data provides exact information of the nanomaterial and peak shifts are important revealing factor for detecting the extent of functionalization. The surface area of nanomaterials is studied by BrunauereEmmetteTeller (BET) technique. The large surface area of nanomaterials makes them available to diverse applications ranging from catalysis, medical, and environmental to many other advanced technologies (Saeed and Khan, 2017) . (c) Surface charge and surface hydrophobicity: The interaction of nanomaterials with the biological system is largely determined by their surface charge and intensity. The surface charge is indirectly determined through zeta potential measurement. Zeta potential plays an important role in determining the stability of colloids (nanoparticle) as well as knowing the intensity of electrostatic attraction between biomolecules and the nanoparticles. High value of zeta potential in either direction (positive or negative) is an indicator of high stability of the colloidal solution. Surface hydrophobicity can also be determined with zeta potential values. Besides, other methods for the determination of hydrophobicity include hydrophobic interaction chromatography, biphasic partitioning, probe adsorption, and contact angle measurements. The latest advancement in the field of studying surface hydrophobicity involves X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, which determines surface hydrophobicity as well as identifies chemical groups (or functional groups) also on their surface (Scholes et al., 1999; Pal et al., 2011) . (d) Electronic and optical properties: The electronic properties of nanomaterials also control most of its optical properties. The optical properties of nanoparticles are mostly dependent on its size and surface property. Nobel metal nanoparticles show strong absorption in UV-visible region. Localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) is the phenomenon that provides a deep insight of electrooptic property of the nanomaterials. Optical property determination is an important factor in determining the photocatalytic activity and hence the application of the nanomaterials. A core analysis of photocatalytic activity helps in deducing the mechanism for photochemical reactions. Using the basic principles of photochemistry (Grothus-Draper's law, BeereLambert law), the characterization of optical properties can be largely done. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopic (DRS) measurement technique is on such method that assists in determining the photoactivity of nanomaterials in terms of absorbance, reflectance, luminescent, or phosphorescent properties. Besides DRS, photoluminescence and null ellipsometer are other means to derive optical properties of these nanoparticles. UV-Vis DRS also helps in determining the bang gap in semiconductor nanomaterials. Bandgap lets us know the photocatalytic activity and material conductivity of these nanomaterials. (e) Magnetic and mechanical properties: Magnetic activity of certain nanomaterials is another important benefit and can be applied in field of catalysis, biomedical techniques, and MRI as well as water remediation. The uneven distribution of electrons leads to formation of magnetic moment in these nanomaterials. The mechanical strength of nanomaterials is measured in terms of modulus, stress, strain, adhesion, or friction.", "Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.", "School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings.", "Are pathogens in outdoor air a health issue at present or will they become a problem in the future?

With advances in medical treatment, greater numbers of disease-susceptible groups, such as immuno-compromised individuals are expected to survive longer in the overall population. This trend may change our understanding of pathogens because many unexpected microbes and infection pathways can appear within this transforming population.", "Summary Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703\u20131\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761\u201312\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764\u2013128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70\u201324\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

Age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, d-dimer, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, prothrombin time, and disease severity were reported to be associated with intensive care unit admission. However, no published works were found about the risk factors of mortality for adult patients with COVID-19. One study compared the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat and nasopharyngeal swab in 17 patients with COVID-19.", "What we know about social distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4,13 where children are a vulnerable group. However, preliminary data on COVID-19 suggests that children are a small fraction of cases and may be less vulnerable than older adults. 14 If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza. Conversely, school closures may be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which may lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures may lead to other adults staying home, which could reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures.", "What is COVID-19, and what do we know so far about its clinical presentation? The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses. At 125 nm, it is slightly larger than influenza, SARS and MERS viruses. It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1]. The near identical gene sequences of 90 analysed cases from outside of China suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early December 2019 from an unknown (likely mammalian) intermediate host [2]. Pangolins are an endangered ant-eating mammal from which scientists in Guangzhou have shown a coronavirus with 99% homology, with a receptor binding domain identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been confirmed, and, in addition, the pangolin's rarity means this may not be the only mammal involved.", "There is no proven treatment at this early stage but we will doubtless have more information about this soon. It can be assumed that non-pharmacologic approaches are effective such as fluid support, oxygen and ventilatory support. Most recently the national data suggests that 17.7%, 10.4% and 7.0% of all cases have disease requiring respiratory support in Wuhan, Hubei (not including Wuhan) and the rest of China (respectively). About a quarter of all require ventilation while 75% require oxygen support only. The variation in severity rates probably reflects the outcomes in an overwhelmed health system. Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill. ECMO is currently being used in China, however, its effectiveness is yet to be determined. Antiviral drugs as well as a variety of other putative treatments are typically being prescribed for deteriorating patients on a compassionate basis. Clinicians would be well aware of such situations but assurance is required that their safety and efficacy are being scientifically assessed so that meaning is brought to bear quickly. Coordination of clinical trials to avoid duplication and ensure that results are rapidly available will be a challenge but the case numbers should facilitate rapid definitive results. (see What is in the pipeline for vaccine development and/or therapeutics?).", "Cardiac complications, including new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction are common in patients with pneumonia. Cardiac arrest occurs in about 3% of inpatients with pneumonia. 21 Risk factors of cardiac events after pneumonia include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, and greater severity of pneumonia at presentation. 22 Coronary heart disease has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections. [22] [23] [24] In this study, increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I during hospitalisation was found in more than half of those who died. The first autopsy of a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure in Jinyintan Hospital showed acute myocardial infarction (data not published; personal communication with a pathologist from the Chinese Academy of Science). About 90% of inpatients with pneumonia had increased coagulation activity, marked by increased d-dimer concentrations. 25 In this study, we found d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL is associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have a reported asso ciation with 28-day mortality in patients with infection or sepsis identified in the emergency department. 26 Contri butory mechanisms include systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that are mediators of atherosclerosis directly contributing to plaque rupture through local inflammation, induction of procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis. [27] [28] [29] In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed on myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, 30, 31 so there is at least theoretical potential possibility of direct cardiac involvement by the virus. Of note, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue has 32 The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of trans mission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. For SARS-CoV, viral RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from about a third of patients as long as 4 weeks after disease onset. 33 Similarly, the dura tion of MERS-CoV RNA detection in lower respiratory specimans persisted for at least 3 weeks, 34, 35 whereas the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection has not been well characterised.", "Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, \u03c7\u00b2 test, or Fisher's exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Considering the total number of deaths (n=54) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints. Previous studies have shown blood levels of d-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases, whereas lymphopenia and cardiovascular disease have been less commonly observed in non-critical or surviving patients with SARS-COV-2 infection. 5 troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, and IL-6, might be unavailable in emergency circumstances. Therefore, we chose lymphocyte count, d-dimer, SOFA score, coronary heart disease, and age as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model.", "The median time from illness onset (ie, before admission) to discharge was 22\u00b70 days (IQR 18\u00b70-25\u00b70), whereas the median time to death was 18\u00b75 days (15\u00b70-22\u00b70; table 2). 32 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 31 (97%) died. The median time from illness onset to invasive mechanical ventilation was 14\u00b75 days (12\u00b70-19\u00b70). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used in three patients, none of whom survived. Sepsis was the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, ARDS, heart failure, and septic shock (table 2). Half of non-survivors experienced a secondary infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The frequency of complications were higher in non-survivors than survivors (table 2) . In univariable analysis, odds of in-hospital death was higher in patients with diabetes or coronary heart disease (table 3) . Age, lymphopenia, leucocytosis, and elevated ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase, d-dimer, serum ferritin, IL-6, prothrombin time, creatinine, and procalcitonin were also associated with death (table 3) .", "Summary Objectives The relative importance of airborne, droplet and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends among other factors on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Methods We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes. Results Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1\u2013102, on hands in the order of 103. Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. Conclusions The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.", "Which of the three transmission modes is responsible for most influenza infections remains highly controversial. 3,4,7e12 Especially the importance of the airborne pathway via droplet nuclei has proved to be contentious e despite often repeated statements such as ''Influenza virus is readily transmitted by aerosols (.)'' 13 (p. 1278 ) and the obvious importance of knowing the significance of this transmission mode for implementing efficient non-pharmaceutical control measures. 14e16 Should, for example, the use of face masks be recommended during a pandemic, when a vaccine is not yet available, on the basis of what we know or do not know about airborne or droplet transmission? Is airborne transmission perhaps only important indoors, but not outdoors, where virus removal by dilution, air circulation and also virus inactivation might be higher? How can airborne infections efficiently be controlled in health care settings? 17e21 One factor contributing to the relative importance of each of the three transmission modes is the inactivation of influenza A viruses in different environmental media. Sometimes, viruses in transmission are described as being ''outside of their natural habitat'' 17 (p. 457); transmission, however, is an integral part of the ''life'' cycle of viruses and thus shaped by natural selection. 22 A full understanding of transmission modes requires a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms on several different levels of organization, from virion structure to aspects of human behavior and social organization. We consider these latter aspects if necessary, but focus on the characteristics of transport medium and their consequences for virus inactivation. The empirical study of these issues is never easy, but especially challenging for aerosols. The size distribution of respiratory aerosols, their size changes after expulsion 2 and subsequent inhalation, 23 the pathogen concentration and the mechanisms of virus inactivation are factors that are very difficult to study empirically. Environmental persistence is key parameter, because it can place strict limits on the impact of a transmission pathway. Despite its probable relevance, and possibly because of the empirical challenges, the issue of environmental persistence and mode of transmission of influenza A has remained a comparatively neglected topic. Charles V. Chapin claimed in 1910 that communicable respiratory infections are transmitted by means of large droplets over short distances or through contact with contaminated surfaces. 24 This claim has remained dominant ever since. The paradigm of droplet and contact transmission experienced a temporary challenge through the pioneering work of William F. Wells, who produced experimental evidence for the existence of droplet nuclei as a means of airborne transmission of respiratory diseases. The airborne route of infection and influenza virus inactivation in aerosols was quite intensely researched from the late 1930s to the early 1980s, 25e44 received some still contested epidemiological support, 45 but then failed to attract noteworthy attention for many years. Outside the community of influenza researchers the topic of airborne transmission and virus inactivation remained of some interest 46 ; a review concluded that airborne transmission is possible for numerous types of viruses. 47 In influenza research, the airborne route only recently has regained significant and controversial interest. 3, 4, 48, 49 There appears to be agreement that airborne transmission is at least possible, but there is strong disagreement about importance. There are a number of reasons for this renewed attention to the airborne transmission route, for example the need to consider and develop non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic 14, 15 or emerging diseases such as SARS where the transmission mode remained controversial and uncertain for some time and it subsequently turned out that airborne transmission was feasible. 50 These developments, and the threat of bioterrorism, 51 have reopened and revitalized the debate about the transmission modes of influenza.", "In terms of therapeutics there is no known effective pharmaceutical agent. There are over 200 registered clinical trials registered in China alone. Putative agents include antivirals; Griffithsin, a spike protein inhibitor, nucleoside analogues eg. remdesivir, ribavirin and protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir. Immunomodulatory and other host targeted agents include interferon, chloroquine and immunoglobulins. Corticosteroids will potentially have benefit for immune mediated lung damage late in the course of disease [6] . Much of the theory stems from what we have learnt from limited trials in other corona viruses [7] .", "Numerous living organisms possess biophotonic nanostructures that provide coloration and other diverse functions for survival. While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing (Chorinea faunus) butterfly and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si(3)N(4) substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties that prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits and show that our device reduces the mean IOP measurement variation compared to conventional rebound tonometry without signs of inflammation.", "These results highlight the advantage of the anti-biofouling approach based on strong hydrophilicity and anti-adhesion properties (Supplementary Fig. S11 -S16). High or moderate aspect-ratio nanostructures either with tapered sharp tips or dome-shaped tips as in C. faunus display potent geometry-dependent bactericidal properties that induce large stresses and deformation on cell walls regardless of their surface chemical composition 43 and actively promote autogenous lysis when placed in contact with mammalian cells 44 . Such anti-biofouling approaches relying on physical lysis could undesirably damage tissues surrounding implants and elicit inflammation. Supplementary Table S1 shows physical lysis occurs on either natural or synthetic nanostructured surfaces if the aspect-ratio of the nanostructures is 1 or greater. Hence, by keeping the aspect-ratio of the nanostructures at 0.45, the anti-adhesion property was leveraged to prevent biofouling without causing any physical lysis. Additionally, the hydrophilicity of the nanostructured surface originates from surface topology, which may provide better long-term reliability over chemical-treatment methods. (See Supplementary Section SI3 and Fig. S17 .)", "Monomolecular arrays of protein or glycoprotein subunits forming surface layers (S-layers) are one of the most commonly observed prokaryotic cell envelope components. S-layers are generally the most abundantly expressed proteins, have been observed in species of nearly every taxonomical group of walled bacteria, and represent an almost universal feature of archaeal envelopes. The isoporous lattices completely covering the cell surface provide organisms with various selection advantages including functioning as protective coats, molecular sieves and ion traps, as structures involved in surface recognition and cell adhesion, and as antifouling layers. S-layers are also identified to contribute to virulence when present as a structural component of pathogens. In Archaea, most of which possess S-layers as exclusive wall component, they are involved in determining cell shape and cell division. Studies on structure, chemistry, genetics, assembly, function, and evolutionary relationship of S-layers revealed considerable application potential in (nano)biotechnology, biomimetics, biomedicine, and synthetic biology.", "For glycosylated S-layer proteins, the long carbohydrate chains were found to be exposed to the ambient environment (S ara et al., 1988a Messner & Sleytr, 1991a) . Adsorption studies using whole cells which are completely covered with glycosylated S-layers revealed that they can bind to hydrophilic, hydrophobic, positively, and negatively charged materials to a comparable extent (S ara et al., 1988a) . In this context, data obtained on cell surface hydrophobicity of a collection of different Lactobacillus strains with and without S-layers have to be taken into account. Contact angle measurements and AFM revealed that cell surface hydrophobicity changed in response to changes in ionic strenghth offering this strains a versatile mechanism to adhere to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces (Vadillo-Rodr \u0131guez et al. Interestingly, cell adhesion of the S-layer carrying strain G. stearothermophilus PV72 was less influenced by the environmental conditions than that of the S-layerdeficient variant T5 (Gruber & Sleytr, 1991) . For the latter, hydrophobic interaction chromatography revealed a more pronounced hydrophilic surface. In the case of the pathogenic organism Aeromonas salmonicida, it could be demonstrated that the presence of the S-layer makes the cell surface much more hydrophobic (Trust et al., 1983) . S-layers are capable of interacting with particles and materials of different physiochemical properties, thereby favoring adherence of whole cells to solid surfaces. In contrast, S-layers from thermophilic Bacillaceae did not adsorb charged macromolecules on their surface or inside the pores because this would hinder the transport of nutrients and metabolites (S ara & Sleytr, 1987a; Weigert & S ara, 1995) .

[5] [6] [7] The exact origin, location, and natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV remain unclear, although it is believed that the virus is zoonotic and bats may be the culprits because of sequence identity to the bat-CoV. 5, 13 According to previous studies on the SARS-and MERS-CoV, epidemiologic investigations, their natural reservoir is bat, while palm civet or raccoon dog may be the intermediate (or susceptible) host for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV. 5, 13 A field study for the SARS-CoV on palm civet ruled out the possibility as the natural reservoir (low positive rate); instead, the prevalence of bat coronavirus among wild life is high and it shares a certain sequence identity with the human SARS-CoV. 14 Therefore, bats are considered the natural host reservoir of SARS-like coronavirus. 13 However, the origin or natural host for the 2019-nCoV is not clear, although it might come from a kind of wild life in the wet market. 1 Theoretically, if people contact or eat the reservoir or infected animal, they could be infected. However, to result in large scaled person-to-person transmission as in the past SARS outbreak, the virus must spread efficiently. Initially, the 2019-CoV outbreak was reported as limited person-to-person transmission and a contaminated source from infected or sick wild animals in the wet market may have been the common origin. 1,2 But more and more evidences came out with clusters of outbreaks among family confirmed the possibility of personto-person transmission. 8, 10, 11, 15, 16 In addition, the involvement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the cellular receptor (like SARS) made droplet transmission to the lower respiratory tract possible. 5, 17 Furthermore, contact transmission like SARS is also likely although the survival time in the environment for the 2019-nCoV is not clear at present. Currently, there was no evidence of air-borne transmission. Viral RNAs could be found in nasal discharge, sputum, and sometimes blood or feces. 1, 9, 10, 13, 15 But whether oral-fecal transmission can happen has not yet been confirmed. Once people are infected by the 2019-nCoV, it is believed that, like SARS, there is no infectivity until the onset of symptoms. 15 However, one report describes infection from an asymptomatic contact but the investigation was not solid. 10 The infectious doses for 2019-nCoV is not clear, but a high viral load of up to 10 8 copies/mL in patient's sputum has been reported. 10 The viral load increases initially and still can be detected 12 days after onset of symptoms. 9 Therefore, the infectivity of patients with 2019-nCoV may last for about 2 weeks. However, whether infectious viral particles from patients do exist at the later stage requires validation.", "Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.", "While we were closely monitoring the dynamic changes of fecal SARS-CoV-2 in our patients, a 6-year-old boy in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, was reported to be under more than 34 days of hospitalization due to prolonged presence of viral RNA in stools after showing negative in respiratory samples. Actually, this phenomenon is not rare among pediatric patients. 27 Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract. 25 However, the researchers did not discuss whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was more common in certain age group than the others (patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 78 years in this study). Therefore, discharged patients might be a potential source of transmission and follow-up after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine is advisable. The limitations of this study should also be noted. In response to the emerging disease, only respiratory specimens were required for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 according to clinical guidelines in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We therefore failed to obtain stool samples from the patients during their first few days of hospitalization and could not determine whether throat swabs and fecal samples showed positive on RT-PCR analysis simultaneously. Moreover, we did not culture the virus isolated from the feces to test the viability nor measure viral loads in the samples due to limited conditions. All rights reserved.

Both criteria predict that there is little residual risk of infectivity, based on cell culture.", "Virus isolation from stool samples was never successful, irrespective of viral RNA concentration, based on a total of 13 samples taken between days six to twelve from four patients. Virus isolation success also depended on viral load: samples containing <10 6 copies/mL (or copies per sample) never yielded an isolate. For swab and sputum, interpolation based on a probit model was done to obtain laboratory-based infectivity criteria for discharge of patients (Figures 1 E, F) .", "In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries).

Sarbecovirus, while the MERS-CoV to Merbecovirus. 13 SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV all cause diseases in humans but each subgroup may have mild different biologic characteristic and virulence. [5] [6] [7] The exact origin, location, and natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV remain unclear, although it is believed that the virus is zoonotic and bats may be the culprits because of sequence identity to the bat-CoV. 5, 13 According to previous studies on the SARS-and MERS-CoV, epidemiologic investigations, their natural reservoir is bat, while palm civet or raccoon dog may be the intermediate (or susceptible) host for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV. 5, 13 A field study for the SARS-CoV on palm civet ruled out the possibility as the natural reservoir (low positive rate); instead, the prevalence of bat coronavirus among wild life is high and it shares a certain sequence identity with the human SARS-CoV. 14 Therefore, bats are considered the natural host reservoir of SARS-like coronavirus. 13 However, the origin or natural host for the 2019-nCoV is not clear, although it might come from a kind of wild life in the wet market. 1 Theoretically, if people contact or eat the reservoir or infected animal, they could be infected. However, to result in large scaled person-to-person transmission as in the past SARS outbreak, the virus must spread efficiently. Initially, the 2019-CoV outbreak was reported as limited person-to-person transmission and a contaminated source from infected or sick wild animals in the wet market may have been the common origin. 1,2 But more and more evidences came out with clusters of outbreaks among family confirmed the possibility of personto-person transmission. 8, 10, 11, 15, 16 In addition, the involvement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the cellular receptor (like SARS) made droplet transmission to the lower respiratory tract possible. 5, 17 Furthermore, contact transmission like SARS is also likely although the survival time in the environment for the 2019-nCoV is not clear at present. Currently, there was no evidence of air-borne transmission. Viral RNAs could be found in nasal discharge, sputum, and sometimes blood or feces. 1, 9, 10, 13, 15 But whether oral-fecal transmission can happen has not yet been confirmed. Once people are infected by the 2019-nCoV, it is believed that, like SARS, there is no infectivity until the onset of symptoms. 15 However, one report describes infection from an asymptomatic contact but the investigation was not solid. 10 The infectious doses for 2019-nCoV is not clear, but a high viral load of up to 10 8 copies/mL in patient's sputum has been reported. 10 The viral load increases initially and still can be detected 12 days after onset of symptoms. 9 Therefore, the infectivity of patients with 2019-nCoV may last for about 2 weeks. However, whether infectious viral particles from patients do exist at the later stage requires validation.", "Diagnostic testing suggests that simple throat swabs will provide sufficient sensitivity at this stage of infection. This is in stark contrast to SARS. For instance, only 38 of 98 nasal or nasopharyngeal swab samples tested positive by RT-PCR in SARS patients in Hong Kong 15 .", "Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.", "How easily the virus is transmitted between persons, and how it affects individual persons and potentially vulnerable population subgroups, such as the elderly or those with chronic health conditions? What is the source of the virus? And how can it spread around the world in such a short time? At the moment, we know relatively little about CoVID-19, except that it is a highly pathogenic human pathogen, possibly a zoonotic agent. Now that a pandemic has occurred, it is critical that countries around the world take steps to stop transmission and save lives. In addition, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f we should actively study its origin, tropism, and pathogenesis with the aim of providing some guidance in dealing with this rapidly spreading epidemic. Challenges remain in several key areas, including the recent cases of people who have tested positive for the virus. Can these cured patients be transmitted to others? All these suggest that we should develop more detailed criteria for the prevention and control of the virus, and more stringent criteria for discharge of patients after treatment.", "Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Shenzhen Center of National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research from January 16 to February 8, 2020. Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good prognosis.", "Patients in this study were tested with the 2019-nCOV nucleic acid test. The specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, sputum, and anal swabs. We found that nasal swabs and anal swabs were positive even without respiratory symptoms such as cough and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea Therefore, the source of samples cannot be selected based on clinical manifestations, and should be submitted multiple times and at multiple sites to avoid misdiagnosis of patients with mild imaging without imaging manifestations. Although there is no clinical evidence that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival pathway [13] , mother-infant, and breast-milk [4] , researchers have detected the virus in urine [14] , saliva [15] , suggesting that novel coronavirus has a wide range of transmission routes.", "It mainly should be distinguished from other known viral virus of pneumonia, such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, SARS-CoV, etc.; J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and also, from mycoplasma pneumonia, chlamydia pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia. In addition, it should be distinguished from non-infectious diseases, such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia [9] . So, laboratory diagnosis is necessary. Identification of CoVID-19 mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection. According to the traditional Koch`s postulates, virus isolation is the \"gold standard\" for virus diagnosis in the laboratory [47] A variety of specimens (such as swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharynx or trachea extracts, sputum or lung tissue, blood and feces) should be retained for testing in timely manner, which gives a higher rate of positive detection of lower respiratory tract specimens [47] . Viral nucleic acids can also be used for early diagnosis, which is the most important thing. So, we should detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid: accurate RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 is with diagnostic value [47] . The full gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has now been obtained and samples can be collected from the upper respiratory tract (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal) and lower respiratory tract (endotracheal aspirate, expectorated sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage) of patients suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection for diagnosis by real time RT-PCR method [48] Also, in the early stage of the disease, the total number of leukocytes decreased or keeps normal, with decreased lymphocyte count or increased or normal monocytes also indicated the diagnosis of CoVID-19 [9] .", "Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 X 10 8 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat-and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat-and lung samples of one same patient. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 6-12 days, but was not followed by a rapid decline of viral loads. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.", "What is COVID-19, and what do we know so far about its clinical presentation? The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses. At 125 nm, it is slightly larger than influenza, SARS and MERS viruses. It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1]. The near identical gene sequences of 90 analysed cases from outside of China suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early December 2019 from an unknown (likely mammalian) intermediate host [2]. Pangolins are an endangered ant-eating mammal from which scientists in Guangzhou have shown a coronavirus with 99% homology, with a receptor binding domain identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been confirmed, and, in addition, the pangolin's rarity means this may not be the only mammal involved.", "The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, sore throat and diarrhoea. On February 14th, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) published the first details of 44,672 confirmed cases, in the biggest study since the outbreak began [3] . Their findings show that COVID-19 was mild for 81% of patients and had an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. Of those confirmed cases, only 2.2% were under 20 years old. Compared to adults, children generally present with much milder clinical symptoms. It is likely that future serological studies will show much asymptomatic disease in children. As opposed to H1N1, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. The severity of the disease appears to be associated with age, with the elderly most at risk; those over 80 years of age had a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 14.8%. The CFR was also increased in those with comorbidities including cardiovascular, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. The cause of death is respiratory failure, shock or multiple organ failure.", "There is a close genetic relatedness between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. The predominant expression of ACE2 in the lower respiratory tract is believed to have determined the natural history of SARS as a lower respiratory tract infection. Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described 9 , these observations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms of clinical pathology. The here-studied patients were enrolled because they acquired their infections upon known close contact to an index case, thereby avoiding representational biases due to symptom-based case definitions. All patients were treated in a single hospital in Munich, Germany. Virological testing was done by two closely-collaborating laboratories using the same standards of technology for RT-PCR and virus isolation, confirming each other's results based on almost all individual samples. Due to extremely high congruence of results, all data are presented together. Only the serological data are based on results from one laboratory.

Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.", "The results from this study have shown that a relatively low concentration of enveloped respiratory viruses may retain infectivity on common hard surfaces for longer than previously thought and may present a real risk of infection to anyone who contacts a contaminated surface. However, human coronavirus 229E, an important pathogenic virus but also a surrogate for MERS coronavirus, which is structurally very similar, was rapidly inactivated on copper alloys. Inactivation results from a combination of direct copper ion attack and reactive oxygen species generation. The latter is particularly important as the copper content decreases, ensuring that rapid inactivation still occurs in alloys with lower percentages of copper. Therefore, incorporation of copper alloys in communal areas could help to reduce infection spread from touching surfaces contaminated with coronaviruses. This is especially important in infectious disease where the infectious dose is low, surface contamination is high, and effective therapies are limited. The mechanism of action of copper is complex and may be enhanced by radical formation but is ultimately nonspecific, ensuring continuous kill and inactivation of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms with completely different morphologies. Concerns about the biocide resistance, possible concomitant drug resistance, and horizontal gene transfer that have been observed with other biocides (51) can be allayed because of the destruction of viral nucleic acid observed following exposure to copper surfaces. It is not feasible to cover every surface in copper, and many materials in the built environment, including stain- of the coronavirus genome revealed a reduction in copy number from virus exposed to copper and cartridge brass surfaces in reverse transcriptase real-time PCR. There was some reduction on stainless steel but none in viral suspension (lightest gray bars), suggesting that this was due to sample drying.

The genomic RNA from virus exposed to copper and brass degraded with increased contact time. This did not occur on stainless steel; the genomic RNA remained as fragments too large to pass through the gel.

Persistence was slightly prolonged on ceramic surfaces. A previous study in our laboratory observed that dry copper and copper alloy surfaces rapidly inactivated MNV-1 and destroyed the viral genome. In this new study, we have observed that a relatively small change in the percentage of copper, between 70 and 80% in copper nickels and 60 and 70% in brasses, had a significant influence on the ability of the alloy to inactivate norovirus. Nickel alone did not affect virus, but zinc did have some antiviral effect, which was synergistic with copper and resulted in an increased efficacy of brasses with lower percentages of copper. Electron microscopy of purified MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and stainless steel surfaces suggested that a massive breakdown of the viral capsid had occurred on copper. In addition, MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and treated with RNase demonstrated a reduction in viral gene copy number. This suggests that capsid integrity is compromised upon contact with copper, allowing copper ion access to the viral genome.", "In our results, the Cu(I) chelator BCS protected coronavirus on brass surfaces, suggesting that Cu \u03e9 migrating from the metal is important in toxicity and supporting the Fenton reaction generation of hydroxyl radicals that was observed. Perhaps the reason brasses were more effective at inactivating coronavirus than copper nickels was the increased Cu(I) release and subsequent ROS generation rather than the zinc content, which had only mild antiviral activity. Presumably, as in bacteria, a multitarget attack on enveloped viruses by copper ions and ROS may result in nonenzymatic peroxidation of the envelope (44) and damage to membrane proteins and the nucleoproteins. We have observed previously (27) that exposure to copper surfaces resulted in significant morphological changes to nonenveloped norovirus, where possible disassociation of the capsid subunits exposed the viral genome to copper inactivation. In this study, we observed rapid damage, including clumping, breakage, membrane damage, and loss of surface spikes, to the coronavirus particles following exposure to copper, and some particles appeared smaller and seemed to have lost rigidity, folding up on themselves. These changes were not observed with virus recovered from stainless steel surfaces.", "Rapid inactivation of human coronavirus occurs on brass and copper nickel surfaces at room temperature (21\u00b0C). Brasses containing at least 70% copper were very effective at inactivating HuCoV-229E ( Fig. 2A) , and the rate of inactivation was directly proportional to the percentage of copper. Approximately 10 3 PFU in a simulated wet-droplet contamination (20 l per cm 2 ) was inactivated in less than 60 min. Analysis of the early contact time points revealed a lag in inactivation of approximately 10 min followed by very rapid loss of infectivity (Fig. 2B) . As observed previously for norovirus, zinc demonstrated a slight antiviral effect compared to that seen with stainless steel (neither metal contains copper).", "Detection of morphological changes to HuCoV-229E using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 \u00b0C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 \u00b0C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 \u00b0C (3.7 min), 80 \u00b0C (2.4 min), and 90 \u00b0C (2.3 min) compared with 60 \u00b0C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 \u00b0C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.", "A total of 4 surface materials were evaluated including stainless steel, aluminum, plastic, and galvanized steel. Stainless steel and aluminum sheets were purchased from Hardware Hank (St. Paul, MN). For the plastic surface, 6-well plastic plates (Nunc, New York, NY) were used, and galvanized steel (28 gal.

Both chelators protected coronavirus from inactivation on copper and brass surfaces, suggesting that release of Cu(I) and Cu(II) is required for antiviral activity. Tiron was protective for the first hour of contact on copper and brass surfaces, indicating that superoxide is directly or indirectly involved in the inactivation mechanism. However, D-mannitol gave minimum protection on copper but prolonged protection on brass surfaces. Increasing the concentration of D-mannitol did not affect the results (not shown). This suggests that copper ions are the main moieties responsible for inactivation of coronavirus on 100% copper surfaces but that generation of hydroxyl radicals becomes more significant as the concentration of copper in the alloy is reduced.

Incorporation of even a few copper surfaces may have an impact in effectively reducing transmission of infectious material from a surface to an individual, provided that stringent, regular, and effective cleaning regimens are employed for all surfaces. The use of copper does not serve as an excuse to relax cleaning regimens. However, the choice of cleaning reagents is critical for copper alloys because it is essential to maintain copper ion release for efficacy, so avoidance of chelators is necessary.", "Summary Objectives The relative importance of airborne, droplet and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends among other factors on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Methods We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes. Results Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1\u2013102, on hands in the order of 103. Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. Conclusions The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.", "Assuming that fomite transmission in most cases involves hands (droplet deposition on surfaces / transfer from surface to hand / transfer to mucosa or conjunctiva), then inactivation on the environmental surface and on human skin will be the two major limiting factors. Enveloped viruses such as parainfluenza virus or F6 have a very low survival on hands 100e103 and this appears to be the case for influenza A virus as well. 104, 105 For inanimate surfaces, porosity is a major factor influencing inactivation rates. At 35e40% RH, typical for indoor environments, influenza A virus survives for more than 24e48 h on stainless steel and plastic surfaces, but drops to undetectable levels after 8e12 h on porous surfaces such as paper tissue, pajamas or paper. 105 Transfer of viable influenza A virus from paper tissue to hands was only possible for 15 min, but transfer from stainless steel to hands for 24 h. The first-order inactivation rates of viruses on porous surfaces are approximately 24 day \u00c01 and 2.9 day \u00c01 on stainless steel; the latter value is an order of magnitude lower than the value reported for glass surfaces. 83 After the transfer to hands from both surface types, viable virus fell to low titers within 5 min; firstorder inactivation rates on hands range from 1300 to 2100 day \u00c01 ; high spontaneous decay of influenza A virus on skin was also found in another study. 106 On Swiss banknotes influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have very low inactivation rates. 107 H1N1 shows a low inactivation rate of approximately 0.05 day \u00c01 . The surprising finding is that influenza A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) showed no significant inactivation whatsoever after 10 days. Nasal mucus has a strong survival enhancing effect, probably mediated in part through stabilization by proteins and salts. 43 This might explain why influenza A virus can be detected on a wide range of fomites in homes and day care centers. 108 The type of metal can strongly affect inactivation rates. Influenza A remains viable for more than 24 h on stainless steel surfaces, but no more than 6 h on copper; the respective inactivation rates are 1.4 day \u00c01 and 33.2 day \u00c01 . 109 This study was performed at 22 C and 50e60% RH. The value for stainless steel is close to the value reported above. Influenza A virus on surfaces is RH sensitive as well; virus deposited and dried on glass slides shows the same pattern of RH sensitivity as in the airborne state. 83 The claim that avian influenza virus of the type H13N7 survives better on non-porous than on porous surfaces 110 is based on maximum detection times (which will depend on initial titer), not on inactivation or survival rates. Some of the calculated inactivation rates do not support the claim made by the authors. The first-order inactivation rate constants are, for example, 1.69 day \u00c01 on steel, 1.32 day \u00c01 on tiles, 0.58 day \u00c01 on cotton fabric and 1.0 day \u00c01 on feathers; the RH in which the experiments were conducted is not reported.", "Surface contamination has recently been found to be more significant than originally thought in the spread of many diseases (12) .

It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many.

The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.", "School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings.", "Abstract We report a familial cluster of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to evidence that a potential transmission of the COVID-19 during the incubation period.

Sarbecovirus, while the MERS-CoV to Merbecovirus. 13 SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV all cause diseases in humans but each subgroup may have mild different biologic characteristic and virulence. [5] [6] [7] The exact origin, location, and natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV remain unclear, although it is believed that the virus is zoonotic and bats may be the culprits because of sequence identity to the bat-CoV. 5, 13 According to previous studies on the SARS-and MERS-CoV, epidemiologic investigations, their natural reservoir is bat, while palm civet or raccoon dog may be the intermediate (or susceptible) host for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV. 5, 13 A field study for the SARS-CoV on palm civet ruled out the possibility as the natural reservoir (low positive rate); instead, the prevalence of bat coronavirus among wild life is high and it shares a certain sequence identity with the human SARS-CoV. 14 Therefore, bats are considered the natural host reservoir of SARS-like coronavirus. 13 However, the origin or natural host for the 2019-nCoV is not clear, although it might come from a kind of wild life in the wet market. 1 Theoretically, if people contact or eat the reservoir or infected animal, they could be infected. However, to result in large scaled person-to-person transmission as in the past SARS outbreak, the virus must spread efficiently. Initially, the 2019-CoV outbreak was reported as limited person-to-person transmission and a contaminated source from infected or sick wild animals in the wet market may have been the common origin. 1,2 But more and more evidences came out with clusters of outbreaks among family confirmed the possibility of personto-person transmission. 8, 10, 11, 15, 16 In addition, the involvement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the cellular receptor (like SARS) made droplet transmission to the lower respiratory tract possible. 5, 17 Furthermore, contact transmission like SARS is also likely although the survival time in the environment for the 2019-nCoV is not clear at present. Currently, there was no evidence of air-borne transmission. Viral RNAs could be found in nasal discharge, sputum, and sometimes blood or feces. 1, 9, 10, 13, 15 But whether oral-fecal transmission can happen has not yet been confirmed. Once people are infected by the 2019-nCoV, it is believed that, like SARS, there is no infectivity until the onset of symptoms. 15 However, one report describes infection from an asymptomatic contact but the investigation was not solid. 10 The infectious doses for 2019-nCoV is not clear, but a high viral load of up to 10 8 copies/mL in patient's sputum has been reported. 10 The viral load increases initially and still can be detected 12 days after onset of symptoms. 9 Therefore, the infectivity of patients with 2019-nCoV may last for about 2 weeks.

To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.", "The relationship between symptoms of a disease and infectiousness to others is critical to the success of containment strategies. Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly influences the ability to control outbreaks 5 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring. 6 Short-course diseases, such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness, like hepatitis A, are impacted more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring; however, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, where persons usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Recent work on isolation for COVID-19 found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited presymptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset. 7 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring and individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays, and imperfect isolation to account for known nosocomial transmission of this respiratory virus. 8 One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. A recent study reporting asymptomatic transmission in Germany 9 was later found to be incorrect or misleading, 10 adding to the confusion. There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval -the time between symptom onset of infector-infectee pairs -which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura et al 11 and Li et al 12 were derived from limited data (24 and 6 infector-infectee pairs, respectively) and in the latter case largely reflected the prior distribution derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these under what conditions it is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. Here, using methods described in previous work 6 and the latest epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19, 11, 12 we compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number ( ) of COVID-19 R e to below the critical threshold of one. While mass restrictions on movements within cities have been implemented during this outbreak and are sometimes referred to as quarantines, here we focus on the effectiveness of quarantine and active monitoring on an individual basis based on contact tracing.", "Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities.

In the province of British Columbia, the Ministry of Health initiated a collaborative evidence-informed process involving a steering committee of representatives from the six health authorities. A Core Functions (CF) Framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. For each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core program paper developed. These documents were distributed to health authorities to guide development of their own renewed public health services. The CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded knowledge translation process. A CF coordinator in each health authority was to facilitate a gap analysis and development of a performance improvement plan for each core program, and post these publically on the health authority website. METHODS: Interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted with a total of 56 managers and front line staff from five health authorities working in the Healthy Living and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention core programs. All interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and verified by the project coordinator. Five members of the research team used NVivo 9 to manage data and conducted a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged concerning implementation of the CF Framework generally, and the two programs specifically. The themes were: \u2018you\u2019ve told me what, now tell me how\u2019; \u2018the double bind\u2019; \u2018but we already do that\u2019; and the \u2018selling game.\u2019 Findings demonstrate the original vision of the CF process was lost in the implementation process and many participants were unaware of the CF framework or process. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed with respect to a well-known framework on the adoption, assimilation, and implementation of innovations in health services organizations. Despite attempts of the Ministry of Health and the Steering Committee to develop and implement a collaborative, evidence-informed policy intervention, there were several barriers to the realization of the vision for core public health functions implementation, at least in the early stages. In neglecting the implementation process, it seems unlikely that the expected benefits of the public health renewal process will be realized.", "'I don't know, maybe because in the past I've been involved in doing their [the Ministry's] research and pulling this together and being very specific about why we're doing something. Whereas this way, the papers are already written and you are just sort of relying on what you get. I know this sounds really odd. But if someone else is doing it for you and then you're rolling it out.' (Chris, Manager) This participant is suggesting that there is something inappropriate about practitioners who are not involved in the development of the plan being responsible for rolling out someone else's plan. In such a situation, it is possible that the commitment needed to implement as intended is missing. Without an understanding of the larger vision, more questions than answers arose in determining how to operationalize programs. For example, participants raised questions such as: 'Is my staff responsible for this? What are common indicators across the region and province and shouldn't we be working towards these? How are other HAs doing this? Some of the activities that we do, cross into other core programs, so how do we deal with that? If we can't do everything in the MCPP, where should we focus our attention?' They perceived a lack of guidance in answering their questions. As one participant put it:", "Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.", "School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings.", "Some participants reported that many people in their organization had never heard of the CF Framework. For example, one participant said, .'\u2026what was interesting, you know, talking about model core programs and people didn't know what I was talking about' (Cameron, Manager). It appeared that the philosophical vision and intents were not adequately communicated throughout the organization, nor were these staff members engaged in a process to develop a shared vision.

The convergence of people, animals, and the environment defines the parameters of One Health and directs attention to the impact this overlap has on public health, disease detection, and control. One Health (sometimes referred to as One Medicine) is a concept that promotes, improves, and defends the health and well-being of all species through the integration of the sciences of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental studies. As microbiologists, we need to be aware of this One Health concept and how it can positively impact our profession by allowing us to be more productive members of the health care team. There are several things we can do to get started. We can review organism pathogenicity and evaluate and question test results that may signal an unusual event or process that led to a disease. We can be alert to the epidemiologic potential of organism isolates from patients as they may apply to infection control or community epidemiology.

Most recently the national data suggests that 17.7%, 10.4% and 7.0% of all cases have disease requiring respiratory support in Wuhan, Hubei (not including Wuhan) and the rest of China (respectively). About a quarter of all require ventilation while 75% require oxygen support only. The variation in severity rates probably reflects the outcomes in an overwhelmed health system. Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill. ECMO is currently being used in China, however, its effectiveness is yet to be determined.

Compared to adults, children generally present with much milder clinical symptoms. It is likely that future serological studies will show much asymptomatic disease in children.

It is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many. The closest is a virus that originated from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is only 79% homologous with the original SARS CoV [1]. The near identical gene sequences of 90 analysed cases from outside of China suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early December 2019 from an unknown (likely mammalian) intermediate host [2]. Pangolins are an endangered ant-eating mammal from which scientists in Guangzhou have shown a coronavirus with 99% homology, with a receptor binding domain identical to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been confirmed, and, in addition, the pangolin's rarity means this may not be the only mammal involved.", "There is uncertainty regarding transmissibility and severitymore information is emerging about the spectrum of disease, especially mild disease, which is not identified using many current case definitions, and about the ease of transmission from person to person. Health agencies are unsure how to model this and estimates vary depending on the variables being used. For instance, SARS was essentially spread later in the disease from patients with more significant clinical pictures, and it was contained by infection control measures particularly in hospitals. The limited spread to family members of health workers and the community was contained by usual outbreak control measures including early identification and management of persons with infection, tracing of contacts with monitoring for onset of fever and/or symptoms, and active engagement of communities.", "Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.", "School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings.", "Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.", "There are other limitations to our analysis. We assume that R0 in places outside of Wuhan is similar to that estimated from early transmission in Wuhan, however we do not know how variation in climate, population structure, contact patterns, control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine, and other factors may impact transmission. This is an important area for future research based on what is observed in different places and the extension of the analysis to explicitly model transmission in each recipient country can be undertaken as more becomes known.", "What we know about social distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4,13 where children are a vulnerable group. However, preliminary data on COVID-19 suggests that children are a small fraction of cases and may be less vulnerable than older adults. 14 If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza. Conversely, school closures may be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which may lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures may lead to other adults staying home, which could reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures.", "Most modelling suggests that the severity of illness is more like influenza than SARS, and there is concern among the public health community because the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood, and the potential for it to become endemic like other respiratory pathogens is unknown.", "Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.", "From the detailed description about traced data, we can know when and what is the state of each infected person and obtain the number of who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized classes, as shown in Figure 1 , which shows the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. Figure 1 (A) gives both newly reported cases and new cases from traced data, and comparison of two time series indicates that the new cases from traced data is about 7 days ahead of the reported cases data. In particular, Figure 1 (B) and (C) give the epidemic status of cases confirmed before February 7 th and 15 th , respectively. Note that although Shaanxi province began to release the case numbers on January 23 rd , 2020, the first imported latent case came to Shaanxi as early as January 10 th , 2020, and the majority of imported cases were latent and came into Shaanxi before the end of January, 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (A). Figure2(B) shows the correlation between the total imported cases and the number of population flow into the Shaanxi province, from which we calculate the proportion of those inflows that are infected.", "What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1\u20131/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2\u00b75 in the early stages of the epidemic,2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.", "Model-based predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID-19. Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure). However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures. Ongoing data collection and epidemiological analysis are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of mitigation strategies, alongside clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19.", "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) and causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China in December 2019. The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002\u20132003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of \u201csuperspreading\u201d events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 in Australia, across five jurisdictions. Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non\u2010Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insig\u200bhtplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coron\u200bavirus-no-place-for-racism-xenop\u200bhobia/).", "Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second-order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases", "Our model has several limitations and some of them could actually be overcome in the near future. Perhaps the most important one has to do with the inability of current large-scale epidemiological models to fully account for behavioral changes in the population when a disease is evolving. As it is the case for the spreading of COVID-19, the information \u2212and more often than desired, misinformation\u2212 travels faster than the disease. This produces undesired effects such as a collapse in the emergency rooms at hospitals, a proliferation of information sources that do not provide sensible advices in all cases, anticipated economic loses and, in general, uncoordinated responses. Therefore, it is a pressing challenge to develop more realistic ways to incorporate in models like the one employed here all these risk-averse responses and reactions. Another limitation of the current study includes the relatively low spatial resolution, which is essentially determined by the data availability. The results however indicate that the level of granularity used here is enough to capture mobility patterns and the effects of possible interventions. Finally, we have not considered the temporal and spatial variability of disease parameters, nor other potentially important characteristics of the host population such as the existence of super spreaders or the age structure, which seems to play a relevant role for this disease, at least in what concerns the case fatality rate. We plan to investigate on all these issues in the near future.", "The second term, , is calculated in development contexts and in emergency medicine, but to our knowledge has not been measured for accute infectious diseases (e.g., influenza or COVID-19) or included explicitly in epidemiological models. It is useful to know the critical value of where school closure stops saving lives and starts increasing mortality, which is defined by the condition", "Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

There is clear human-to-human transmission in family clusters in China and beyond, transmission from close face-to-face social contact, especially in small enclosed spaces, and transmission from failed infection prevention and control measures in health facilities. In addition, the experience in Wuhan shows that transmission can be massive in a short period of time with thousands of new patients diagnosed daily.", "Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.", "The relationship between symptoms of a disease and infectiousness to others is critical to the success of containment strategies. Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly influences the ability to control outbreaks 5 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring. 6 Short-course diseases, such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness, like hepatitis A, are impacted more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring; however, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, where persons usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Recent work on isolation for COVID-19 found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited presymptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset. 7 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring and individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays, and imperfect isolation to account for known nosocomial transmission of this respiratory virus. 8 One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. A recent study reporting asymptomatic transmission in Germany 9 was later found to be incorrect or misleading, 10 adding to the confusion. There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval -the time between symptom onset of infector-infectee pairs -which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura et al 11 and Li et al 12 were derived from limited data (24 and 6 infector-infectee pairs, respectively) and in the latter case largely reflected the prior distribution derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these under what conditions it is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. Here, using methods described in previous work 6 and the latest epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19, 11, 12 we compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number ( ) of COVID-19 R e to below the critical threshold of one.

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study.

Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.", "The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20035048 doi: medRxiv preprint NLR lo IgG hi or NLR lo IgG lo phenotype. A third of patients with NLR lo IgG hi had critical illness, suggesting that IgG response alone could lead to disease deterioration. Furthermore, high Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3, proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10 were noted in NLR hi IgG hi or NLR hi IgG lo phenotypes. Accordingly, we speculated that anti-IgG humoral response directly contributed to tissue damage. In SARS-CoV/macaque models, Liu et al. found anti-spike IgG, the presence of high anti-spike IgG prior to viral clearance, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted proinflammatory cytokines monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and IL-8 production and monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation, eventually cause fatal acute lung injury during SARS-CoV infection. 13 Thus, we proposed potential mechanisms associated with different immune response phenotypes and presented specific treatment recommendations which would be helpful in guiding clinical decision ( figure 3 ). For example, in the NLR hi IgG lo group, both virus directly mediated tissue damage and CRS are responsible for disease development. In this scenario, anti-virus, tocilizumab, and serum from convalescent should be considered. However, serum from convalescent should only be used in patients with low IgG levels and should not be used in the patients with high IgG level since its use might aggravate the disease especially in the patients with NLR hi IgG hi phenotype. 14 Tocilizumab treatment might not be beneficial for patients with low NLR, because these patients are in the immunosuppression stage rather than in CRS stage. 15 Our retrospective investigation had some limitations. Firstly, virus titers were not monitored during SARS-CoV-2 infection and patient recovery. Higher IgG levels, however, were previously detected in patients who had negative pre-discharge fecal RT-PCR results and SARS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques that had markedly reducing virus titers. 7 Secondly, it is unknown whether the change or increase of IgM or IgA is related to disease severity. The mechanism responsible for the immunopathologic reaction of IgG remains elusive. Finally, the IgG response and its correlation to the severity of COVID-19 in patients without high-dose corticosteroid intervention have not been addressed. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that severe COVID-19 was associated with a more robust IgG response that can be developed as an acquired immunity-related marker to predictive disease severity, along with other innate immunity-relate makers such as NLR. Further study on the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is warranted.", "Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.", "7. Future directions to control the spread of the disease Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. A guideline was published for the medical staff, healthcare providers, and, public health individuals and researchers who are interested in the 2019-nCoV [29] . The early death cases of COVID-19 outbreak occurred primarily in elderly people, possibly due to a weak immune system that permits faster progression of viral infection [8, 12] . The public services and facilities should provide decontaminating reagents for cleaning hands on a routine basis. Physical contact with wet and contaminated objects should be considered in dealing with the virus, especially agents such as faecal and urine samples that can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15, 16] . China and other countries including the US have implemented major prevention and control measures including travel screenings to control further spread of the virus [13] . Epidemiological changes in COVID-19 infection should be monitored taking into account potential routes of transmission and subclinical infections, in addition to the adaptation, evolution, and virus spread among humans and possible intermediate animals and reservoirs. There remains a considerable number of questions that need to be addressed. These include, but are not limited to, details about who and how many have been tested, what proportion of these turned positive and whether this rate remains constant or variable. Very few paediatric cases have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? Of the ones that have so far been tested, how many have developed severe disease and how many were tested positive but showed no clinical sign of disease? There are some basic questions that would provide a framework for which more specific and detailed public health measures can be implemented.", "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.", "Our molecular phyloecological study demonstrates that spike protein shows significant Darwinian selection along two ancestral branches related to SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, suggesting their adaptive evolution to recognizing their own cell receptors. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicate a high similarity of RBD sequences of spike protein between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19related CoV. Subsequent ancestral sequence reconstruction and convergent evolution analyses reveal an unusually high incidence of parallel and convergent amino acid substitutions between them, suggesting an extremely strong adaptive evolutionary convergence in spike protein. In addition to spike protein, we also found evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Finally, considering that SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV have posed serious concerns to public health and safety, it should be noted that many other bat SARS-like CoV strains that were evolutionarily convergent with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV recognized in this study may be potential novel coronaviruses to infect humans in the future.

To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.", "The relationship between symptoms of a disease and infectiousness to others is critical to the success of containment strategies. Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly influences the ability to control outbreaks 5 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring. 6 Short-course diseases, such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness, like hepatitis A, are impacted more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring; however, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, where persons usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Recent work on isolation for COVID-19 found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited presymptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset. 7 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring and individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays, and imperfect isolation to account for known nosocomial transmission of this respiratory virus. 8 One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. A recent study reporting asymptomatic transmission in Germany 9 was later found to be incorrect or misleading, 10 adding to the confusion. There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval -the time between symptom onset of infector-infectee pairs -which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura et al 11 and Li et al 12 were derived from limited data (24 and 6 infector-infectee pairs, respectively) and in the latter case largely reflected the prior distribution derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these under what conditions it is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. Here, using methods described in previous work 6 and the latest epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19, 11, 12 we compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number ( ) of COVID-19 R e to below the critical threshold of one. While mass restrictions on movements within cities have been implemented during this outbreak and are sometimes referred to as quarantines, here we focus on the effectiveness of quarantine and active monitoring on an individual basis based on contact tracing.", "Models that enable the continent to better allocate scarce resources to better prepare and respond to the COVID-19 epidemic are crucial. The modelling study by Marius Gilbert and colleagues in The Lancet identifies each African country's risk of importation of COVID-19 from China, using data on the volume of air travel from three airports in provinces in China to African countries. Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability. In the model, the risk mainly originates from Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing. The study provides a valuable tool that can help countries in Africa prioritise and allocate resources as they prepare to respond to the potential introduction and spread of COVID-19.", "Because of the high volume of air traffic and trade between China and Africa, 1 Africa is at a high risk for the introduction and spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); although only Egypt has reported the first case, from a non-national. 2 The greatest concern for public health experts is whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic, with sustained year-round transmission, similar to influenza, as is now being observed in several countries. 3 What might happen to Africa-where most countries have weak health-care systems, including inadequate surveillance and laboratory capacity, scarcity of public health human resources, and limited financial means-if a pandemic occurs? With neither treatment nor vaccines, and without pre-existing immunity, the effect might be devastating because of the multiple health challenges the continent already faces: rapid population growth and increased movement of people; existing endemic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria; remerging and emerging infectious pathogens such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa haemorrhagic fever, and others; and increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases.", "Evolutionary convergence may occur by chance or by Darwinian selection. Our results showed that the evolutionary convergent sites found in this study were mainly restricted to two genes (S and ORF3a, Fig.  1 ), and in particular, they were centered within the RBD of the S gene. This biased distribution of evolutionary convergent sites is difficult to explain according to chance; rather, Darwinian selection would be favored as a plausible explanation. In support of this, we used CONVERG2 31 to evaluate the probability of the occurrence of our observed convergent sites of spike protein between the two ancestral branches leading to SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, and the results showed high statistical significance (p = 0.000000), regardless of whether the JTT model or Poisson model was used.

Moreover, we observed an apparently accelerated evolution of RBD of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV related to their phylogenetic intermediates (Fig.  3) , and we detected a significant Darwinian selection of the S gene along two branches (branches C and K) of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). These lines of evidence may strongly support the evolutionary convergence found in this study as a result of adaptive evolution. Regarding the possible adaptive evolutionary convergence, previously proposed causes, such as gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer 21,32,33 , are less likely because only single-copy S genes were found in all 35 genomes examined and evolutionary convergent sites presented an apparently biased distribution pattern. Parallel and/convergent evolution, which occur through point mutation, could contribute to our observed evolutionary convergence, but it could not account for the unusually high incidence of convergent sites observed in this study, representing a rare finding in previous studies 20- 26 . Recent studies have shown a relatively high likelihood of occurrence of homologous recombination in spike protein 7,34,35 , and especially, it is considered that the RBD of 2019-nCov may be derived from a recombination event between that of human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like CoV 35 . If this is the case, the homologous recombination, if any, may have occurred between the ancestors (branches C and K) of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, accounting for their unusually high incidence of convergent sites observed in this study.", "Considering that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are distantly related, but show high similarity in the RBD protein structure and can use the same cell receptor, ACE2 5-11 , an evolutionary convergence may have occurred between them. In the present study, we employ a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach 14-16 , which uses a comparative phylogenetic analysis of functional gene sequences to determine the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, and we examine the possible molecular basis underlying the phenotypic convergence between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Our results reveal positive selection signals and evolutionary convergent amino acid sites of the spike protein in both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV and their related coronaviruses, providing new insights into understanding the evolutionary origin of their phenotypic convergence.", "Given the strong evolutionary convergence of RBD of spike protein between the two clades, COVID-19related CoV and SARS-related CoV, the coronaviruses of the two clades may have more likely adapted to similar or the same receptor. To date, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have been known to be capable of using the ACE2 receptor in human host 5,6,9,10 , but the receptors of their phylogenetic relatives from the two clades, COVID-19-related CoV and SARS-related CoV, are less clear 4,5,36,37 . Regarding the bat SARSlike CoV, Rs4231 and Rs7327 are known to be able to use human ACE2 receptor 37 , while WIV16 is capable of using the ACE2 receptor from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) 4 . The receptors of Rs9401, BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B, and BatCoV RaTG13 remain to be explored. Further studies on the receptors of these bat SARS-like CoVs in their natural reservoirs are badly needed to determine whether ACE2 or other candidates, if any, represent their shared cell receptor, leading to their strong evolutionary convergence of spike protein.", "Given their genome-level phylogenetic disparity, the high similarity of RBD protein sequences between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their evolutionary convergence in the spike protein.

It should be noted that the 35 evolutionary convergent sites of spike protein were apparently underestimated, since those amino acid sites with alignment gaps were not considered by the approach used. Still, these 35 sites represented an unusually high incidence of evolutionary convergence sites, which have rarely been found in previous studies related to molecular convergent evolution 20-26 . This suggests a strong evolutionary convergence between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV. On completion of our data analyses, one of the most recent studies showed that the RBD of the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV is nearly identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with only one amino acid difference 27 , suggesting that Pangolin-CoV also belongs to the clade of COVID-19-related CoV. It should be noted that the RBD sequences of two other coronavirus strains, BM48-31 (GU190215) and BtKY72 (KY352407), were grouped with SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 3, Fig. S4 ), suggesting an evolutionary convergence among them. In addition to these evolutionarily convergent coronavirus strains, intriguingly, we found the evidence of evolutionary convergence of the spike protein between the ancestral branch leading to SARS-related CoV and the ancestral branch of COVID-19-related CoV and its sister strains (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21), which harbored 9 evolutionary convergent amino acid sites (Fig. S5) . These results suggest that the spike protein may have been subjected to a successive evolutionary convergence among ancestral coronavirus strains leading to SARS-related CoV, COVID-19related CoV and CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21.", "Given the selection intensification of S gene in 2019-nCoV since its evolutionary divergence from RaTG13, we conducted comparative sequence analyses between the two. We found that there were more than 20 amino acid differences between them, and most of them were located within RBD, especially RBM (Fig. S2) , suggesting a high variability of RBM. Given the importance of RBM for receptor binding, we further conducted a comparative sequence analysis among all the coronavirus strains studied to examine its variability. The results showed high sequence variability, with insertion and/or deletion and amino acid substitutions among the coronavirus strains studied (Fig. 2) . Despite the high variability of RBM, strikingly, we found that SARS-CoV and its phylogenetic relatives-including WIV16 (KT444582), Rs4231 (KY417146), Rs7327 (KY417151), Rs9401 (KY417152), and BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B (MK211376), called SARS-related CoV here, shared many identical or nearly identical amino acids with their phylogenetically distant coronavirus strains, including 2019-nCoV and RaTG13, which we called COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 2) . These shared amino acids were clearly distinct from bat SARS-like CoV that were phylogenetic intermediates between them (Fig. 2) . Further analyses showed that such identical amino acids shared between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV were not restricted to RBM, but rather, they were scattered throughout the spike protein, with a total of 32 such sites, which were centered on RBD (28 sites in total, Fig. S3 ). To further examine whether such similarity occurred in other proteins, we analyzed all 11 genes studied among these coronaviruses, and we found that one additional gene, ORF3a, contained eight such sites (Fig. 1) . The existence of these shared amino acids between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their high sequence similarity. In support of this, we reconstructed maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenies using full-length RBD protein sequences, and both showed that SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV were grouped in the same clade, with relatively high support, which is consistent with two previous studies 6,7 , at the same time, their phylogenetic intermediates were clustered in distinct clades (Fig. 3,  Fig. S4 ). The phylogenetic uniting of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV provide evidence of their high similarity of RBD protein sequences.", "We used likelihood ratio tests based on the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml program of PAML 17 to examine the possible Darwinian selection of all 11 genes annotated in the 2019-nCoV genome (NC_045512). Positively selected genes (PSGs) were found by the branch-site model ( Table 1) , independent of the initial value variation of parameters (kappa and \u03c9). Specifically, for the branches leading to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, no PSGs were found, nor were PSGs found along the branches leading to their sister coronaviruses. However, we detected PSGs along the ancestral branch (branch C) of 2019-nCoV and its sister taxon, RaTG13, as well as along the ancestral branch (branch K) of SARS-CoV and its sister taxa, WIV16 and Rs4231 (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). For branch C, three PSGs (S, Orf1ab and N) were found, and for branch K, only one gene (S) was found to be under positive selection (Table 1) . Orf1ab encodes replicase and N encodes nucleocapsid 18 . Intriguingly, the S gene was subject to Darwinian selection in both branches, C and K. This gene encodes the spike protein, which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion 6 . The finding of Darwinian selection on the spike protein may suggest its adaptive evolution to the host receptors. To further examine the possible adaptive evolution of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV to a human host, we used RELAX 19 to analyze the relative selection intensity change of the 11 genes along the branches leading to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV compared with their most recent ancestors, branches C and K, respectively (Tables S1-2). Among the 11 genes examined, gene S along the 2019-nCoV branch exhibited a significant selection intensification signal (K = 30.54, p = 0.000, Table S1, Fig. S1 ), and this remained robust in four independent runs. We also found that the ORF6 gene showed slight selection intensification (K = 1.81, p = 0.000) along the SARS-CoV branch (Table  S2) , while its statistical significance only received two supports among five independent runs. For the selectively intensified gene S along the 2019-nCoV branch, 0.46% of the amino acid sites (about five amino acids) were under positive selection, while most sites (86.63%) were under purification selection (Table S1 ). This may suggest that 2019-nCoV was subject to an adaptive evolution during its adaption to possible intermediate and/or human hosts.", "Previous studies show that spike protein interacts tightly with a related protein ORF3a and they likely coevolved [28] [29] [30] . If their coevolution does occur, we may expect that the evolutionary convergence of the spike protein found may have led to the occurrence of the evolutionary convergence of ORF3a as well.", "The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2) has caused the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has emerged as a serious public health concern. The clinical and pathological features caused by 2019-nCoV resemble those seen in SARS 1-3 , which is caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have been determined to be of bat origin, with possible intermediate hosts prior to infecting humans 4,5 . Phylogenetic studies have shown that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, but they are distantly related 5-8 , with a sequence identity of 79.6% at the whole-genome level 5 . One recent study showed that 2019-nCoV is more similar to a bat coronavirus (RaTG13), with a sequence identity of 96.2% at the whole-genome level, than many other coronaviruses from different hosts, suggesting a phylogenetic affinity of 2019-nCoV to bat coronavirus compared with SARS-CoV 5 . Despite their relatively distant phylogenetic relationships, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are both known to be capable of infecting humans using the same cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 5,6,9,10 , and their protein structures of receptor-binding protein spike (S) are found to be highly similar to each other 10,11 , suggesting their phenotypic convergence. The spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, and it is important for host tropism and transmission capacity 6 . The spike protein of coronaviruses comprises two subunits, S1 and S2.

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.", "Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of an outbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions.

There is clear human-to-human transmission in family clusters in China and beyond, transmission from close face-to-face social contact, especially in small enclosed spaces, and transmission from failed infection prevention and control measures in health facilities. In addition, the experience in Wuhan shows that transmission can be massive in a short period of time with thousands of new patients diagnosed daily.", "There is no proven treatment at this early stage but we will doubtless have more information about this soon. It can be assumed that non-pharmacologic approaches are effective such as fluid support, oxygen and ventilatory support. Most recently the national data suggests that 17.7%, 10.4% and 7.0% of all cases have disease requiring respiratory support in Wuhan, Hubei (not including Wuhan) and the rest of China (respectively). About a quarter of all require ventilation while 75% require oxygen support only. The variation in severity rates probably reflects the outcomes in an overwhelmed health system. Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is potentially of benefit and we will know more particularly when cities with higher technology health systems become affected and ECMO is truly tested in the most severely ill. ECMO is currently being used in China, however, its effectiveness is yet to be determined. Antiviral drugs as well as a variety of other putative treatments are typically being prescribed for deteriorating patients on a compassionate basis. Clinicians would be well aware of such situations but assurance is required that their safety and efficacy are being scientifically assessed so that meaning is brought to bear quickly. Coordination of clinical trials to avoid duplication and ensure that results are rapidly available will be a challenge but the case numbers should facilitate rapid definitive results. (see What is in the pipeline for vaccine development and/or therapeutics?).", "Both influenza and coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infection that can lead to morbidity and mortality, especially in those who are immunocompromised or who have no existing immunity to the viruses. Indeed, while the COVID-19 should not be taken lightly, influenza is a much bigger problem, but because it is relatively common and has been around for a long time, it does not receive the attention that new viral outbreaks do. The COVID-19 is scary because it is new and we do not know a lot about it yet. New viruses are always scary because we have little to no protective immunity against them and we do not have vaccines. There is work going on to understand and develop preventive strategies to deal with this COVID-19 threat. However, universal precautions to limit its spread are very important right now until a new vaccine or another strategy is available.", "What measures are likely to be successful in curbing its further spread?", "What is in the pipeline for vaccine development and/or therapeutics?", "Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.", "School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings.", "The virus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is in the species SARS-like corona viruses.

Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%.

The Chinese method has proven to be successful. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, and the simplest and most direct thing that can explain this is the data (Fig.7) .", "Summary The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.", "In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control persontoperson transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures. 10 Isolation is the separation of ill people from non infected people, and usually occurs in hospital settings, but could also be done at home for mild infections. 11 For isolation to be successful in preventing transmission, case detection should be early-ie, before the onset of viral shedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding. For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6-11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling early isolation before transmission. 12 The number of secondary cases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms. 13 For SARS, a highly sensitive case definition was used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). All suspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruled out. Implementing optimal isolation by itself was modelled to be more costeffective than implementing suboptimal isolation and quarantine together. 14 Secondary household transmission was low in Singapore (6\u00b72%), indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients. Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in households was 10%, with a linear association between secondary attack rate and the time that the index patient spent at home after symptom onset. 15 In Singapore, healthcare associated transmission accounted for more than 90% of all cases. 16 Once full measures were in place, almost all patients were promptly isolated before secondary transmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singapore was propagated by five superspreading events, 16 including three super spreading events as a result of atypical clinical manifestations of SARS. 17 Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideally combined with medical observation during the quarantine period, of close contacts of infected patients during the incubation period. 18 The premise for successful quarantine is prompt and comprehensive contact tracing of each and every confirmed patient. Quarantine can take place at home or in designated places such as hotels, and both of these options were used during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contacts had to record their temperatures, and were visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public healthcare team. If the contact developed symptoms, they were investigated at a designated healthcare facility. The principle is that if the person under quarantine developed illness, that person would not have any close contacts to spread the disease, effectively reducing the R\u2080 of the outbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitude of efforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23 103 contacts as requiring quarantine. 19 Legally enforceable quarantine orders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checks in Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed at the home of each contact in Singapore. 16, 20 Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectious individuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow the spread of disease, a possible next step is to apply communitywide containment measures. Community wide containment is an intervention that is applied to an entire community, city, or region, designed to reduce personal interactions. 10 These interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine. 11 Enforcement of communitywide contain ment measures is far more complex than isolation or quarantine because of the larger number of people involved. China best exemplified this largescale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones and placing people under collective quarantine in villages, cities, or institutions. 21 In April 2003, the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with guidelines and control measures that were national, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed, under central guidance. The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May. Immediately, the R\u2080 decreased greatly and consistently. 22 In May, 2003, China locked down Beijing and closed more than 3500 public places in an effort to curb community spread.", "First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.", "COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease of global public health concern. Efforts to control the COVID-19 epidemic are likely to require an evidence-based, multifactorial approach. First, there is a need to limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread. Second, there is a need to rapidly identify, isolate, and provide optimised care for patients. Third, we need to identify and reduce transmission from the animal source or sources. Fourth, we need to address", "Coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, Hubei and spread to all provinces in China and other countries. Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen.

As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training.", "As we look to the future of epidemic prevention and control, we believe that telemedicine systems have the potential to play a role in addressing emergencies and large-scale outbreaks in high uncertainty settings. As telemedicine has inevitably altered the traditional working relationships within the healthcare network, how to ensure high-quality communication among healthcare practitioners poses a significant challenge. As such, frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving focused communication among clinical staffs from hospitals at different levels in the healthcare system is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling patients with possible COVID-19 infection 3 . However, we have found that high quality of communication is not always maintained during the telemedicine coordination. Therefore, a learning telemedicine system platform for coronavirus care was developed across connected hospitals, serving as the overarching authoritative source for diagnostic decision making and knowledge sharing for treatment. The platform could aggregate COVID-19 patient records across 126 connected hospitals and rapidly expand to enable open collaborations with key stakeholders such as government authorities, research institutions and laboratories. The lessons learned from this crisis can provide insights to guide public health institutions as they implement telemedicine to increase resilience to future epidemic outbreaks.", "What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic.1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1\u20131/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2\u00b75 in the early stages of the epidemic,2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.", "Model-based predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID-19. Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure). However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures. Ongoing data collection and epidemiological analysis are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of mitigation strategies, alongside clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19.", "To prevent further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, 31 Provinces in China Mainland had raised their public health response level to the highest state of emergency (level-1) by January 29, 2020. The Chinese government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic, many of which have far exceeded what International Health Regulations required, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement. Wuhan had prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement restriction in human history to prevent infectious disease spread (Tian et al, 2020) . Hundreds of millions Chinese residents, including 9 million Wuhan residents, have to reduce even stop their inter-city travel and intra-city activities due to these strict measures.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is infecting people throughout the world. It is probable that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be transmitted to people experiencing homelessness, which will become a major problem in particular in North America where there are sizable populations of people experiencing homelessness in nearly every metropolitan city in the USA and Canada. In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007\u201319).1 The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2 estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada. People experiencing homelessness live in environments that are conducive to a disease epidemic. Many people experiencing homelessness live in congregate living settings\u2014be it formal (ie, shelters or halfway houses) or informal (ie, encampments or abandoned buildings)\u2014and might not have regular access to basic hygiene supplies or showering facilities, all of which could facilitate virus transmission. People experiencing homelessness are a vulnerable group, and their potential exposure to COVID-19 might negatively affect their ability to be housed, and their mental and physical health. People experiencing homelessness aged younger than 65 years have all-cause mortality that is 5\u201310 times higher than that of the general population.3 COVID-19 infection might further increase this mortality disparity.", "If cities impose a lockdown to prevent COVID-19 transmission, there are few emergency preparedness plans to transport and provide shelter for the large number of people experiencing homelessness. In lockdowns, public spaces are closed, movement outside homes are restricted, and major roads of transport might be closed, all of which might negatively affect people experiencing homelessness. It is unclear how and where unsheltered people experiencing homelessness will be moved to if quarantines and lockdowns are implemented. In such a scenario, closures of shelters and other high-density communal settings (eg, drop-in centres and soup kitchens) are possible, which could increase the number of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness and reduce their access to needed services. Lockdowns and disease containment procedures might also be deleterious to the mental health of people experiencing homelessness, many of whom have fears around involuntary hospitalisation and incarceration. 11 In response to COVID-19, the State of Washington has declared a state of emergency, allowing cities to take extraordinary measures, which has included King County moving people infected with COVID-19 to housing units that were originally intended to provide housing for people experiencing homelessness. 12 As other cities follow suit, these actions might further displace people experiencing homelessness and put them at greater risk of COVID-19. Another complicating matter is that in December, 2019, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case of Martin v City of Boise, upholding a ruling that cities cannot arrest or punish people for sleeping on public property unless cities have provided adequate and accessible indoor accommodations. This legal precedent prevents the criminalisation of homelessness, but it is unclear if and how it will be applied during COVID-19 outbreaks.", "Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.", "We did not analyze second-order benefits from screening, such as potential to raise awareness. Official recommendations emphasize that screening is an opportunity for 'risk communication' in which travellers can be instructed how to proceed responsibly if symptoms develop at the destination (World Health Organization, 2020d). Alongside increased general surveillance/alertness in healthcare settings, such measures could help reduce the risk of local transmission and superspreading, but their quantitative effectiveness is unknown. Once limited local transmission has begun, arrival screening could still have merit as a means to restrict the number of parallel chains of transmission present in a country. Once there is generalized spread which has outpaced contact tracing, departure screening to prevent export of cases to new areas will be more valuable than arrival screening to identify additional incoming cases. Altogether, screening should not be viewed as a definitive barrier to case importation, but used alongside on-the-ground response strategies that help reduce the probability that any single imported case spreads to cause a self-sustaining local epidemic. The cost-benefit tradeoff for any screening policy should be assessed in light of past experiences, where few or no infected travellers have been detected by such programs (Gostic et al., 2015) ."], "title": [], "doi": []}, "How personal protective equipment (PPE) helps to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission in health care and community settings?": {"answer": ["Background Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (HCP) from infectious diseases.

When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.", "The level of protection offered by PPE used in health care settings has not been evaluated in depth. Product evaluation tests typically involve only components of the PPE (eg, the penetration of fluid through the textile, not the seams in the garment or performance in the field), 18, 19 and federal agency representiatives and others have been called on to test the permeability of textiles to specific infectious agents. 37 Although there is room to improve the realism of this type of product testing, it is equally important to evaluate how PPE ensembles perform in the field, where human behavior and individual pieces of PPE influence protection. The 2014-2015 EVD outbreak motivated substantial research about the potential for self-contamination associated with doffing complex PPE ensembles, 26 and more work about ensemble performance during care activities. Hall et al 38 evaluated 5 PPE ensembles intended for use with suspected EVD patients, using a complex health care activity simulation with fluorescent simulated body fluids, and found contamination under the PPE and other flaws with all ensembles tested. Herlihey et al 14 evaluated 7 PPE ensembles designed for use with highly infectious diseases, using a human factors lens, and found problems with protection, comfort, and function of all ensembles testing during simulated care activities or doffing. This research highlights that existing pieces of PPE are imperfect and should be evaluated for performance before implementation. Although sophisticated, formal research methods can be used, a lot of information can be gained with fewer resources. For example, in the Chicago area, HCP used visual inspection and colored liquids (eg, Kool-Aid [The Kraft-Heinz Co]) to evaluate dermal coverage and fluid impermeability of PPE, respectively, to increase confidence in PPE selection decisions during EVD preparations. 5 Implementation of a systematic risk-based process for selection of a PPE ensemble to protect HCP from infectious diseases benefits from a team with expertise in occupational health, infectious diseases, human factors, and health care activities. The questions in Table 1 are intended to help ensure that PPE ensembles are evaluated holistically, but may not be complete.

Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.

An improved understanding of pathogen transmission and the institution of strategies to protect health care providers against infection are needed in infectious disease outbreaks. This review connects what is known about Ebola virus transmission with personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to arrest nosocomial transmission. Methods Articles pertaining to filovirus transmission and PPE in filovirus outbreaks were reviewed and findings are presented. In addition, studies that evaluated PPE and donning and doffing strategies are presented. Findings PPE is one step in a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy that is required to protect health care providers. Given that the Ebola virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact of mucous membranes and cuts in the skin with infected patients and/or their bodily fluids, it is necessary to cover these potential portals of infection with PPE as part of a structured and instructed donning and doffing procedure. Implications Current recommendations about PPE and the donning and doffing processes are based on anecdotal experience. However, the use of non-human viruses can help provide evidence-based guidelines on both PPE and donning and doffing processes.", "Outbreaks of EVD, with the exception of the Reston subtype, have occurred exclusively in central sub-Saharan Africa and more recently in West Africa where the climates are known for high ambient temperatures and humidity throughout the year. PPE worn in these settings significantly increase the risk of heat stress and pose yet another risk to the HCP. The risk of heat stress when wearing PPE depends on a number of factors, including length of work shift, ambient temperatures, hydration status, and preexisting medical conditions among others. Strategies to mitigate the risk of heat stress for HCP must be implemented such as the use of buddy systems to monitor the health of providers inside the high-risk area, hydration breaks in between shifts, and consideration of time limitations in staffing determinations. In addition, other strategies were used in the current outbreak, including the use of cooling vests and air conditioning, which have extended the time that providers can spend with patients. Ongoing studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are evaluating the effect of different types of PPE on core body temperature. 42 Recommendations from the CDC for reducing heat stress-related complications include the following 43 : (1) educate HCP how PPE places them at a higher risk of heat-related illness, (2) acclimatize HCP to PPE conditions by gradually increasing their time working in PPE, (3) stay well hydrated, (4) watch for signs and symptoms of heat-related illness, and (5) ensure adequate breaks in between shifts to rest and cool down.", "In the context of pathogen exposures among HCP, we recommend that the following 3 questions be considered in the JHA to identify infectious hazards: (1) How does the HCP contact the patient's body?

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic. Awareness of the national pandemic preparedness plan is likely to promote prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs and surveillance activity.", "Our results indicate that primary care practices in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan lacked essential components for pandemic influenza preparedness. Of the seven topics of pandemic preparedness and response, we found that PCPs were particularly not well prepared with respect to PPE and BCP. PPE is recommended as the main method for protecting primary healthcare workers and patients from pandemic influenza and other infectious diseases [18, 19] . However, primary care clinics were less likely than hospitals to keep adequate supplies of PPE. There was significantly less recommended high-level PPE such as N95 masks, gowns, and eye protection at clinics than at hospitals. A systematic review that investigated the efficacy of PPE for protection against respiratory viruses suggested that PPE is highly effective at preventing the spread of SARS. Odds ratios for various PPE (with a lower OR meaning more protective) are: masks (OR 0.32); N95 masks (OR 0.09); gloves (OR 0.43); gowns (OR 0.23); and hand washing, masks, gloves and gowns combined (OR 0.09) [21] . Shaw et al. [12] reported that the successful containment of SARS outbreaks depends on the appropriate use of infection control measures such as PPE [22] . In the case of influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, appropriate use of PPE, such as gloves, seemed to reduce the risk of A(H1N1)pdm09 transmission [23] . Insufficient infection control preparedness increases the probability that PCPs, especially clinic-based PCPs, will be exposed to (and contract) respiratory infectious diseases. This vulnerability can reduce the capacity of community clinics to respond to a large number of patients that require treatment during a pandemic, and puts the health of all patients attending local health care services at risk.", "We propose a systematic risk-based approach for the selection of PPE against infectious agents\u2212endemic or emerging\u2212in health care settings.

Body coverings, however, are also marketed as offering bloodborne pathogen protection and frequently tested using the American Standard Test Method F1670 or F1671. Beyond performance, body protection should be selected with consideration for sizing and range of motion.", "First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.", "First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped.

Surgical helmets were used outside the operating room by health care workers during the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak, apparently for the first time. 21 Surgical helmets worn with loose-fitting hoods may look and feel like PAPRs to the wearer, but surgical helmets are not respirators as they do not filter the air prior to its introduction into the face or head covering. ummarized", "PPE that is too large or too small may limit usability. For example, fabric may bunch at the wrist when gowns are too large, whereas gowns that are too small may not cover the wrists or may limit arm motions. 14 Evaluation of a PPE ensemble can be staged. First, visual inspection can evaluate fit and identify gaps at junctions between pieces of PPE. Second, tracers can be used to evaluate penetration during care activities and contamination during doffing. Finally, user evaluation can determine ease of PPE use, impact on job performance, and physiological and psychological impact. In experimental settings, a variety of tracers have been used. Unlike bacteriophage tracers, fluorescent materials can be readily visualized in training and simulation settings. 26 Lower-tech options include colored liquid (Kool-Aid; The Kraft-Heinz Co, Glenview, IL) or chocolate syrup. User evaluation may include self-report or survey, observation, and biological measures of physiological parameters. 27, 28 ", "PPE is one of the several strategies for protecting HCP from occupationally acquired infectious diseases. From the perspective of occupational health, PPE should be used only when engineering and administrative controls are insufficient to adequately reduce exposures. However, PPE is the default strategy in health care, as reflected in the standard and transmission-based infection control precautions. 1 This makes it particularly important that the PPE be chosen with caution and reason. The rationale for PPE selection is not always transparent, which means that decision making will be neither reproducible nor convincing to HCP. This issue was apparent in the changing guidelines for PPE during the 2014-2015 EVD. 5 The risk-based approach we propose in this study enables transparent decisionmaking, even in the face of uncertainty or disagreement, because each step of the approach can be documented, allowing review (and critique) by others."], "title": [], "doi": []}, "What is role of the environment in COVID-19 transmission?": {"answer": ["Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza).", "We show that the observed patterns of COVID-19 are not completely consistent with the hypothesis that high absolute humidity may limit the survival and transmission of this new virus.
